<p id="welcome_to_the_">Welcome to the readers, welcome to the editors, welcome to the contributors. We’re all glad to have you along for this trip. A few words on what this is for, how it started, and perhaps where it’s headed. Though we don’t really know where it’s headed. We’ll find that out on the journey.</p>
<p id="ive_been_follo">I’ve been following biology for a few years now. I’m not a biologist, and haven’t taken biology since 7th or 8th grade, over 40 years ago. But I have watched it from a distance, and increasingly, it feels to me like something that’s about to explode: it feels a lot like computing did in 1975, before there were PCs, but when a friend of mine got an 8008 and a used teletype and built a computer in his dorm room. That computing event signaled a lot of things. In '75, computing was arguably already 25 years old. But up to that point, it had been done by people with PhDs, people who wore white lab coats, people who had inconceivably large amounts of funding and built machines the size of houses. What my friend did was demonstrate that computing wasn’t the property of a priesthood with lab coats: it was something that anyone could do.</p>
<p id="were_now_seein">We’re now seeing that same shift in biology. Students are making glowing <span class="keep-together">E. coli</span>, both at community labs like <a class="ulink" href="http://genspace.org" target="_top">Genspace</a> and <a class="ulink" href="http://biocurious.org" target="_top">BioCurious</a> and in high schools.  <a class="ulink" href="http://igem.org" target="_top">iGEM</a> exposes thousands to the idea of building with standard biological parts. We’re seeing community laboratories spring up all over the world: literally on every continent except Antarctica. Experiments that formerly required a fully equipped laboratory with hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of equipment can now be done in a community hackerspace, equipped with little more than a homemade PCR machine and centrifuge powered by a Dremel tool. We’re discarding the lab coats (if not the purple rubber gloves).</p>
<p id="one_unfortunate">One unfortunate theme has stood out in my many conversations with biologists, though: "Yeah, I think something is happening in Hoboken (or Austin, or Juneau, or Calgary), but I don’t know what."  While there is a large and active biohacking community, it’s poorly connected.  The players don’t know who each other are and what’s going on across the community.  It’s symptomatic that one of the world’s largest gatherings of DIY biologists was organized by the FBI.  They were friendly, but that’s not the issue: if it takes the FBI to bring us together, we aren’t talking to each other enough.</p>
<p id="thats_the_prob">That’s the problem we’re fixing with BioCoder.  BioCoder is a newsletter for synthetic biologists, DIY biologists, neuro biologists—anyone who’s interested in what’s happening outside the standard academic and industrial laboratories.  We plan to include:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist" id="articles_about__id1"><ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Articles about interesting projects and experiments, such as the Glowing Plant
</li>
<li class="listitem">

Anything that’s interesting or useful—you tell us!
</li>
</ul></div>
<p id="not_all_of_the_">Not all of the above, not in every issue.  But as much as we can.  We’d like to publish BioCoder quarterly. Although the first issues are free, we’d eventually like this to become self-sustaining.</p>
<p id="to_do_that_of_">To do that, of course, we’ll need contributions.  Send a note to me or Nina DiPrimio, our volunteer editor, and we’ll set you up.  If you’re unsure whether your idea is good enough—it probably is, but feel free to pitch an idea before writing it up.</p>

<p id="as_i_write_this">As I write this article, I’m reflecting on the long expanses of otherworldly playa I’ve just left, watching sandstorms pass in front of me while in altered mental states and contemplating the future of our beloved biotech industry.</p>
<div class="informalfigure" id="informalfigure_id1"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="http://orm-chimera-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/1230000000737/images/2013-08-31_13.15.10.png"></div></div>
<p id="i_have_until_r">I have, until recently been living a double life with one foot in the corporate biotech world and another deeply in the world of biohacking/radical science (working on <a class="ulink" href="http://www.nature.com/naturejobs/science/articles/10.1038/nj7459-509a" target="_top">DIY biolabs</a> and equipment, <a class="ulink" href="http://www.genescient.com/" target="_top">longevity research</a>, and <a class="ulink" href="http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/print-edition/2012/07/20/biohackers-go-solo-in-quest-to-find.html?page=all" target="_top">ALS therapeutic development</a>). I believe in the principles of citizen science and shared (or at least <span class="emphasis"><em>leaky</em></span>) IP as a means of accelerating scientific progress, but I felt I needed to play my part in the "real" biotech industry. That changed three months ago when I realized that to create the innovation we want in biotech, we may have to burn the bridges that got us here and re-create it ourselves, with or without the dinosaur the current biotech industry has become.</p>
<p id="since_argu">Since 1978—arguably the birth of the biotech industry when Genentech created the <a class="ulink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genentech" target="_top">first GMO producing insulin</a>—Biotech has become profitable and also heavily regulated. Biotech venture capitalists, the original sources of risk capital, have become risk-fearing middlemen/women who have been cowed into seeking safe returns for their masters (limited partners) and obsessed with spinning the right story to their customers (big pharma/biotech companies). Much of the shift away from risk has been rightfully laid on the FDA’s door for an <a class="ulink" href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/theapothecary/2013/08/31/how-congress-encourages-shortages-of-cancer-drugs/" target="_top">increase in regulatory burden and uncertainty</a> that has spread as best practice globally and mired the pace of innovation. Regardless, large corporations and academia can no longer be entrusted to move radical science forward—their world has become a world of committees, budget allocation negotiations, and quarterly/yearly cycles, lacking in vision and with fear of failure. So where does it leave us? The refugees of the Biotech Valley of Death?</p>
<p id="the_power_they">The power they’ve taken from the people will return to the people, whether these vested interests want it or not. Biotech and medicine have advanced at a glacial pace, but a massive disruption is coming that will destroy the antiquated business models in the biotech, monopolistic healthcare, and pharmaceutical industries. As technology’s pace continues to quicken, the biotech industry is beginning to benefit from a digitization of biology, the maker movement, quantified self, grinders/transhumanists, crowdsourcing, and a resurgence in local production technologies like 3D printers. A small group of hobbyists (several thousand globally) has emerged over the last couple of years and has begun building biotech equipment for 1/10th to 1/1000th the cost, creating novel open source diagnostic/medical devices, and therapeutically experimenting on themselves, as well bootstrapping and forging new paths in bioscience, like creating commercially available, genetically modified, glowing plants.</p>
<p id="the_business_mo">The business models for these emerging biotech industries are still evolving, but a true hunger is emerging from consumers and patients for new products offered through crowdsourcing sites, such as microbiome analysis; cheap and effective hormone analysis; novel industrial enzymes; algae-powered lights; true disease modifying therapeutics for established diseases and therapeutic life extension; cheap DIY biolab equipment; and technologies that amplify human senses, like the <a class="ulink" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/sciencenotfiction/2011/01/05/biohackers-and-grinders/#.UiW8bGRgaFQ" target="_top">electromagnetic implants</a> pioneered by grinders (i.e., those willing to biohack their own bodies). PWC has estimated that the biotech industry will be worth about <a class="ulink" href="https://emarketing.pwc.com/ReAction/images/West_Coast_Tax_Roundtable_Presentation_10_26_11_FINAL_share.pdf" target="_top">$1.2 trillion globally by 2020</a>, but this is based on a very conservative view of the industry, and with radical disruption and the creation of new products like synthetic meats, regenerative medicine, unconventional materials, and industrial enzymes, as well as the potential for homegrown biofermentation of many other products, the market for the "new" biotech industry will be vast and shifting.</p>
<p id="in_healthcare_">In healthcare, I look forward to seeing the oligopolies that have stifled innovation and kept patients' healthcare prices high and access lower to come crashing down as our fellow biohackers create innovative ways to allow people to ferment their own products; even getting FDA approval for a novel drug will no longer be a practical issue if you personally have control over the means of production. As biohackers, we aren’t interested in preserving the status quo but in overthrowing it for the betterment of humanity. The homebrew computer club was the past—the future belongs to those who homebrew biotech!</p>

</h1></div>
<div><div class="author"><h3 class="author"><span class="othername">Michael Scroggins</span></h3></div></div>
</div></div>
<p id="in__sociol">In 1936, sociologist Robert Merton wrote an article titled “The Unanticipated Consequences of Purposeful Social Action.” Merton argued that all purposeful action in the social world creates series of unanticipated consequences that trail the action as a wake trails a ship. Per Merton, this quality gives human action a reflexive character; consequences unforeseen at the initiation of a course of action often affect the very course of that action. Whereas some consequences are serendipitous, others are more ominous.</p>
<p id="which_brings_us">Which brings us to the 2012 FBI/DIYbio meeting in Walnut Creek, CA. During the three days of meetings, multiple FBI agents addressed the conference attendees and explained that they work for the “new FBI,” not the “old FBI.” At key points, FBI agents rose to their feet and gave the kind of personal testimony to the difference between the old FBI and new FBI that you might expect in an evangelical church. Whereas the old FBI was a policing agency that busted down doors, the new FBI is an intelligence organization that gathers, sorts, and most importantly, classifies information based on forecasted threats. The old FBI wanted to cuff you; the new FBI wants to get to know you.</p>
<p id="the_line_demarc">The line demarcating the old from the new, per the agent’s testimony, was the events leading up to the 9/11 attacks. It was not the actual attacks per se, but rather the activities of the attackers in the months leading up to 9/11 that sparked the change at the FBI. The hijackers' flight training was referenced at multiple points as an example of something that the new FBI would be aware of through relationships forged with flight training instructors and that the old FBI would, and did, pass over. Which is to say, if you are doing something with biology outside of established institutional boundaries, then you will probably meet your local FBI agent at some point.</p>
<p id="a_serendipitous">A serendipitous consequence of the FBI’s interest in DIYbio was the conference serving as a vehicle for the DIYbio community to meet face to face, which would be impossible without FBI sponsorship. While the FBI was busy lobbying attendees about the benefits of getting to know their local anti-terrorism agent, a counter education was taking place during informal get togethers outside the conference venue. A good portion of attendees must have taken note of the “FBI visit” instructions during a side trip to Noisebridge, a San Francisco hackerspace. Even more discussed strategies for working with or around the FBI in between more prosaic discussions about finding suitable landlords and insurance agents, talking to the media, dealing with local regulatory agencies, and attracting/vetting potential lab members.</p>
<p id="a_more_ominous_">A more ominous consequence was the implicit connection drawn by the FBI between DIYbio laboratories and flight schools. The new FBI assumes that DIYbio laboratories may be breeding terrorists along with bacteria. While the FBI is out to build friendly working relationships with DIYbio, the tacit admission that a DIYbio laboratory is a potential threat and amateur biologists, if not assumed guilty, are not assumed innocent either, is a new and consequential fact of living with the new FBI; the FBI directorate covering DIYbio falls under the rubric of weapons of mass destruction—and the harshest punishments the US government can offer. Finally, it is not at all clear how the FBI keeps tabs on the DIYbio community or with which other US government agencies (or foreign governments) they might share information. As Merton warned: “Here is the essential paradox of social action—the 'realization' of values may lead to their renunciation.”</p>

<div><h1 class="title">Chapter 4. “Is this Legal?"</h1></div>
<div><div class="author"><h3 class="author"><span class="othername">Patrik D’haeseleer</span></h3></div></div>
</div></div>
<p id="is_this_legal">“Is this legal?” is probably the #1 question people ask us when they hear about the Glowing Plant project (well, after “can I have one?," of course). The short answer is yes. But the long answer is far more interesting.</p>
<p id="regulatory_over">Regulatory oversight in the US over genetically modified organisms (GMOs) is covered by an alphabet soup of laws and agencies. Different rules apply when you are dealing with a GMO food crop such as soy (covered by the Food and Drug Administration [FDA]), a microbe, an animal, or anything that has been engineered using a plant pathogen. I would hesitate to call this a patchwork quilt of regulations, because a patchwork quilt isn’t supposed to have any holes in it, and these regulations definitely do: big, ragged, oddly shaped holes.</p>
<p id="most_plant_gene">Most plant genetic engineering has historically been done by taking advantage of the plant pathogen Agrobacterium tumefaciens. You may have seen Agrobacterium at work if you’ve seen a tree with a large outgrowth on its trunk. Agrobacterium is a bacterium (duh) that infects plants. During infection, it injects some of its own DNA into the plant, subverting its host’s machinery to make a nice little home for the bacteria. Plant genetic engineers have been using that trick to their own advantage by engineering Agrobacterium to inject whatever genes they want to insert into the plant instead. However, the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) has been understandably cautious about releasing any plant that has been infected by this pathogen, especially an engineered strain of Agrobacterium that could potentially infect other plants in the environment. In fact, this has historically been one of the primary justifications the USDA has used for regulating GMO plants.</p>
<p id="now_it_turns_o">Now, it turns out that Agrobacterium isn’t the only tool genetic engineers have at their disposal to get genes into plants. In 1987, Klein and Sanford discovered that you can literally fire tiny bullets loaded with DNA into cells using an air gun. And when I say tiny, I do mean tiny: the usual ammunition for this “gene gun” is gold nanoparticles that are 1/100th the width of a human hair. Each gold particle is coated with strands of DNA coding for the genes we want inside the cell. The use of gold allows the bullets to be much smaller than the size of the cell, yet heavy enough to carry enough momentum to pierce the tough plant cell wall. This is the same reason that real bullets are made out of lead (or the even heavier depleted uranium) except that the gold particles will be inert once inside the cell.</p>
<p id="the_use_of_this">The use of this gene-gun technology to circumvent the USDA’s regulations on non-food plants did not escape the notice of the 800-pound gorilla in the field of plant engineering. Monsanto, in collaboration with Scotts Miracle-Gro, has been developing a bluegrass strain (the lawn variety, not the banjo variety) that was engineered to be resistant to their favorite herbicide, glyphosate (a.k.a. Roundup). Because nobody but your dog eats lawn grass, it’s not covered by FDA regulations, and since they used gene-gun technology instead of our friend Agrobacterium, it’s not covered by USDA’s plant pathogen–based regulations. Scotts/Monsanto saw a huge gap in GMO regulations and waltzed right through it! Mind you, there were still plenty of voices saying that they should never have gotten away with this. After all, there are plenty of weed grasses that their bluegrass could potentially outcross with, and by inserting the herbicide resistance genes, they’ve given this grass an evolutionary advantage wherever there are traces of Roundup in the environment. But get away with it they did: the USDA ruled that their bluegrass did not pose a risk to become an agricultural pest, and that was that.</p>
<p id="now_compare_th">Now, compare that Roundup Ready bluegrass with our little Glowing Plant: Arabidopsis is not a very hardy plant, and since it is self-pollinating, it is highly unlikely to outcross with more vigorously growing weeds to begin with (unlike grasses). Also, rather than giving it a fitness advantage by making it resistant to herbicides, the genes we’re inserting into its genome will drain a small amount of its energy to produce light, so it will likely do slightly worse than its unmodified cousins in the environment. Other than that (and the fact that Monsanto is a multibillion dollar company with thousands of lawyers), the two are fairly analogous.</p>
<p id="so_where_monsan">So where Monsanto waltzed through the regulatory gap, we will be happy to sneak through after it and give you something you really want: not just another water- and herbicide-guzzling lawn, but a glowing garden of bioluminescent plants.</p>
<p id="mind_you_i_hav">Mind you, I have nothing against rational, sensible regulation of genetically modified organisms. This is after all a very powerful technology. We also regulate car manufacturers, because we prefer our cars not to fall apart on the roadway. But if billion-dollar companies can get away with bringing an herbicide-resistant grass to the market without any regulatory oversight, then surely our ragtag band of <span class="keep-together">biohackers</span> should be allowed to create a little glowing plant as well?</p>
<p id="so_that_was_th">So, that was the long answer: yes, what we’re doing is legal. We have talked to the relevant regulatory agencies, and Monsanto already set the precedent with their Roundup Ready grass. There is still a small possibility that our Glowing Plant project might get shut down by one of the alphabet soup agencies, but then they’d need to reverse their decision on Monsanto as well. And if a bunch of DIYbio amateurs are able to insert some more rational thought into the national debate around GMO regulation, then, personally, I wouldn’t consider that a bad outcome either.</p>

<p id="the_customs_off">The customs officer raised an eyebrow. I carefully explained the nature of my stay in Canada. My arrival in Victoria on July 26th represented the first stop on a year-long worldwide tour of do-it-yourself biology (DIYbio). I’ll get my hands dirty in community biolabs as well as examine the social, ethical, and legal questions that are tied to the movement. It just may not be the easiest thing to explain when crossing a border.</p>
<p id="i_graduated_las">I graduated last May from Grinnell College in Iowa where I studied biology, economics, and entrepreneurship. As I was exploring synthetic biology, I stumbled upon DIYbio and was immediately captivated; it seemed to fuse all my interests together beautifully. I applied for a Thomas J. Watson Fellowship, which allows for a year of independent study outside the United States. My proposal generated more odd looks—this time a good thing—and was just weird enough to be accepted. As a result, I’ll be sharing my experiences as I visit different DIYbio groups around the globe, spanning from the United Kingdom to Indonesia.</p>
<p id="canada_made_for">Canada made for an obvious first stop, and Derek Jacoby, founding member of the Victoria Makerspace, welcomed me to my inaugural lab. Immediately, I was thrown into an introductory class where the students made E. coli express green fluorescent protein from a jellyfish species. As a summer fellow at Carnegie Mellon University, I had done this lab once before, except this time the other participants weren’t undergraduates. Instead, I was joined by a woman with a background in communications, two high school students, a network specialist, and an onlooking real estate developer. Everyone was pleased to see their own colonies glow under a UV lamp. Genetic engineering by amateurs—it’s not just something people envision in TED talks.</p>
<p id="for_an_independ">For an independent project, I am exploring DNA origami, which may have profound implications for DNA nanotechnology. This field was established in 2006 by Paul Rothemund, who figured out that a long, single-stranded DNA "scaffold" can be guided to fold with many different "staple" strands, which allows the generation of highly specific 2- and 3D nanostructures.<a href="#ftn.id528655" class="footnote"><sup class="footnote" id="id528655">[1]</sup></a> Essentially, if you can conceive of a shape, you can make it out of DNA, and all sorts of fascinating applications are being explored.</p>
<p id="for_example_do">For example, Douglas, Bachelet, and Church built a nanorobot for delivery of molecular cargo.<a href="#ftn.id528669" class="footnote"><sup class="footnote" id="id528669">[2]</sup></a> Essentially like a clam shell, the inside features binding sites for cargo, such as an anti-cancer drug. The clam shell is locked with an aptamer that’s bound to a partially complementary strand. When this aptamer encounters its target molecule, it preferentially binds to it, opening the lock. That target molecule, ingeniously, can be a protein found  on the outside of cancerous cells. Thus, the clam shell releases its molecular payload upon just the bad guys that need to be killed. Such specificity may dramatically reduce the toxicity of the drugs. For my own project, I designed a proof-of-principle 2D light bulb, which Bachelet was kind enough to review. Next, I’ll build a 3D design.</p>
<p id="to_what_extent_">To what extent is DNA origami feasible for DIY biologists? There are questions as to whether DNA origami can be made cost accessible, but the method does have some advantages. First, with student status, the design software caDNAno, built on top of Autodesk’s Maya 2012, is free. Second, the whole shebang is done in a one-pot reaction, so reagent costs are minimal. Third, the single-stranded scaffold is commonly the M13mp18 virus; three trillion copies can be purchased for about $30.<a href="#ftn.id528699" class="footnote"><sup class="footnote" id="id528699">[3]</sup></a></p>
<p id="the_largest_cos">The largest cost limitation to building the nanostructure are the oligonucleotide staples. Fortunately, in many cases, expensive oligonucleotide purification is unnecessary.<a href="#ftn.id528711" class="footnote"><sup class="footnote" id="id528711">[4]</sup></a> More typically, a set of staples is likely around $700 at the 25 nmol scale.</p>
<p id="dna_origami_req">DNA origami requires access to an atomic force microscope for 2D imaging or a transmission electron microscope for 3D imaging. Microscope access may be the largest obstacle for any DIY effort. Fortunately, the Victoria Makerspace is working out access to these microscopes through an agreement with a local university, so it is conceivable that others can come to similar arrangements.</p>
<p id="it_is_my_hope_t">It is my hope that this project will elucidate DNA origami’s potential for DIYbio. Even if the wet work of DNA origami is too costly for many groups, the field is still idea- and design-accessible. Like with iGEM, undergraduates are already forming teams, producing designs, and executing projects through the <a class="ulink" href="http://biomod.net/" target="_top">BIOMOD competition</a>. I have compressed a crash course in DNA origami to 20 minutes, and it will be followed up by another lesson in caDNAno.</p>
<p id="by_the_time_of_">By the time of my next entry, I will have crossed the Atlantic and joined the Manchester Digital Laboratory in the United Kingdom. I’ll report on a DNA barcoding project as well as my work exploring the social, ethical, and legal issues that surround DIYbio. As I travel, I’ll begin to develop an understanding of the differences that exist between DIYbio groups and the environments in which they exist. How do DIYbio groups differ in their interests and projects? How do legal considerations change? How do local mores affect public perception of DIYbio and GMOs? I will share what I find as I continue my global voyage.</p>

<p id="the_point_of_sy">The point of synthetic biology is editing genomes—adding and removing functionality until the organism you are creating behaves exactly as you want it to. Since this behavior is determined by DNA, these additions and deletions must take place in the genome.</p>
<p id="when_i_was_firs">When I was first getting into synthetic biology in 2008, some friends and I formed an iGEM team at the  University of Victoria. Everything we worked on was based around BioBricks: biological units of defined functionality. BioBricks contain specific DNA sequences at each end of the DNA so that they can be precisely snipped out with restriction enzymes and then put back together in the order you want them. I remember being amazed at the specificity of restriction enzymes—to be able to cut a piece of DNA at a very precise point confers an amazing ability to move segments of DNA around as functional units and create genetic circuits. However, all the circuits we created had to be on small, circular segments of DNA called plasmids. This introduced some significant limitations: we could only create new circuits, existing functionality in the chromosomal DNA was inaccessible to us, the plasmids had to contain antibiotic resistances, and if we ever placed the new constructs in an environment without that antibiotic selection, our hard-won changes would be gone in just a few generations. So everything we created felt temporary. And it all came about because our palette of restriction enzymes was fairly limited. This is rapidly in the midst of changing.</p>
<p id="before_talking_">Before talking about how that change is occurring, let’s delve into restriction enzymes.<a href="#ftn.id528812" class="footnote"><sup class="footnote" id="id528812">[5]</sup></a> Evolved as a bacterial defense mechanism, a particular bacteria generates an enzyme that cuts a specific segment of DNA. Most frequently, it cuts DNA possessed by an invading bacteriophage—a virus that infects a bacteria—so that the phage DNA is disrupted without harming the bacteria itself. Our menu of restriction enzymes is derived from these evolutionary battles between bacteria and phage and are named after the bacteria they are isolated from. For instance, EcoRI (pronounced “Eco-R-One”) is the first restriction enzyme isolated from E. coli and cuts precisely at the sequence GAATTC. About 600 of these enzymes are available commercially, which provides a significant set of options for how one can design and manipulate synthetic DNA. But it does no good when trying to cut a segment of DNA that does not match up to one of the available enzymes, so it is of very limited utility in editing natural chromosomal DNA.</p>
<p id="restriction_enz">Restriction enzymes are DNA-binding proteins, and the activity of a protein depends largely on its shape. Although protein structural prediction is improving, it is still a very difficult problem, so creation of artificial restriction enzymes to cut at a particular point is nontrivial. Some approaches to creating sequence-specific DNA binding proteins do exist, though. The first to arrive on the scene were ZFNs (zinc finger nucleases). More recently, TALENs (transcription activator–like effector nucleases) provide another alternative. In both of these cases, though, the resultant DNA binding protein is rather cumbersome to create and suffers from problems such as off-target binding. In practical terms, this means that it is difficult and expensive to create a new zinc finger or TALEN to target a specific DNA location for <span class="emphasis"><em>in situ</em></span> genome editing.</p>
<p id="in_late__h">In late 2012, however, the first paper was published on adapting for gene editing a defense mechanism that exists in <span class="emphasis"><em>Streptococcus pyogenes</em></span> called CRISPR (Clustered Repetitively Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats).<a href="#ftn.id528858" class="footnote"><sup class="footnote" id="id528858">[6]</sup></a> In combination with a protein called cas9, CRISPR binds and cuts DNA at a specific location. Unlike restriction enzymes discussed thus far, however, the exact sequence at which DNA is bound and cut is determined by a short sequence of RNA. This means that no complex protein engineering is required to target a new specific section of DNA, just a short section of RNA. This RNA is most commonly provided as DNA in a plasmid, allowing the cell machinery itself to create the guide RNA to target the CRISPR-cas9 complex appropriately. It is functionally a programmable restriction enzyme! In the year since the first publication of this approach, the CRISPR-cas9 system has been used to cheaply and effectively edit DNA in humans,<a href="#ftn.id528874" class="footnote"><sup class="footnote" id="id528874">[7]</sup></a> mice,<a href="#ftn.id528882" class="footnote"><sup class="footnote" id="id528882">[8]</sup></a> zebrafish,<a href="#ftn.id528891" class="footnote"><sup class="footnote" id="id528891">[9]</sup></a> yeast,<a href="#ftn.id528899" class="footnote"><sup class="footnote" id="id528899">[10]</sup></a> bacteria,<a href="#ftn.id528907" class="footnote"><sup class="footnote" id="id528907">[11]</sup></a> and vascular plants.<a href="#ftn.id528916" class="footnote"><sup class="footnote" id="id528916">[12]</sup></a> There is reason to believe that it is a fully generalizable system for <span class="emphasis"><em>in situ</em></span> genome editing. It has even been used already to make germline edits in mice, which were successfully passed down to subsequent generations.<a href="#ftn.id528929" class="footnote"><sup class="footnote" id="id528929">[13]</sup></a></p>
<p id="although_a_deta">Although a detailed discussion of the mechanism of action of CRISPR-cas9 systems is beyond this quick introduction,<a href="#ftn.id528942" class="footnote"><sup class="footnote" id="id528942">[14]</sup></a> it is worth briefly noting the highlights of the system to better understand its strengths and limitations. First, there is a particular DNA sequence needed, known as the PAM sequence (proto-spacer associated motif), which corresponds to the particular nucleotide sequence NGG. As an indication of the frequency of this motif, there are approximately 642,000 sites on the yeast genome where the CRISPR complex can bind with maximal efficiency. Some elements of the system can be manipulated to bind with reduced efficiency if an exact PAM sequence is not located near your target of interest, so most genes can be targeted with some degree of efficiency.<a href="#ftn.id528956" class="footnote"><sup class="footnote" id="id528956">[15]</sup></a> Next, the guide and spacer RNAs have some length requirements to ensure optimal specificity. But beyond these bioinformatic tasks, the production of a highly specific CRISPR-cas9 complex consists merely of the synthesis of a few dozen bases of oligos and inserting the CRISPR and cas9 plasmids into your target of interest, a far cry from the complexity of previous approaches.</p>
<p id="in_all_the_case">In all the cases discussed here (zinc finger nucleases, TALENs, and CRISPR-cas9), the end result of this specific targeting is a break in the DNA at that point. Either in only a single strand<a href="#ftn.id528973" class="footnote"><sup class="footnote" id="id528973">[16]</sup></a> or in both strands. The goal of this single- or double-stranded break is to enable new genetic material to be inserted, or to disable an existing gene. The insertion of a new genetic sequence depends on a DNA repair process known as homologous recombination—essentially built-in DNA repair machinery to knit the DNA back together. If you provide compatible DNA donor sequences, a certain portion of the time they will get stitched into that specific point of breakage in the chromosomal DNA. Or, if you cut at two adjacent points in the genome and do not provide a compatible donor DNA sequence, the target will get stitched back together without the segment you want deleted.</p>
<p id="were_entering_">We’re entering an exciting era in genetic engineering where we have tools accessible to not only create new genetic circuits on plasmids, but also to edit the existing chromosomal DNA of a wide variety of organisms, and to do it using tools that are low cost and accessible. At BioCurious, we’ve begun (but not yet seen results of) CRISPR-cas9 editing of the E. coli genome. You’ll hear more about those efforts in future reports. But there’s a concern: the tools to work with CRISPR-cas9, and many other related technologies, are the purview of academic researchers, and their commercial use requires individually negotiated licenses. As a nonprofit institution, BioCurious is able to order materials from Addgene, a repository of research plasmids, for research and educational use of those materials at BioCurious. As an educationally focused nonprofit, BioCurious is essentially acting in the role of a research university in supervising the material transfer agreements (MTAs) that protect the intellectual property rights of the original depositors of biological material. It’s a model that seems to be working well, but blurs the line between DIY biology and the support and legal structures that underpin institutional biology. Along with safety and regulatory concerns, the legal status of the essential tools and organisms that form the core of modern synthetic biology are geared toward institutions rather than individuals. It’s a core challenge of DIY biology to figure out how to work with those structures in such a way that individual freedoms to explore and learn are balanced with the needs that led to the development of the institutional control structures in the first place.</p>

<p id="although_promis">Although promises of a paperless office may not have materialized yet, a bumper crop of ELNs (electronic laboratory notebooks) have been making the rounds to ease the gathering, processing, and dissemination of data. As we are constantly being reminded, without proper management, this torrent of data will soon overwhelm the scientific community with data anarchy, grinding progress to a halt and heralding in yet another Dark Age. Perhaps not, but the efficient management of projects when you have multiple students working on a summer iGEM (international genetically engineering machines team) becomes an absolute necessity, or things can quickly spiral out of control.</p>
<p id="elns_range_from">ELNs range from feature-laden systems that not only help you gather data and manage projects but, with accounting and inventory features, can essentially help you to manage an entire lab, to more basic systems that focus on individual and small group projects. Though still in beta mode, Synbiota is in the latter category and proves to be a good entry-level electronic lab notebook that allows those unfamiliar with this format of data recording and sharing to hit the ground running.</p>
<p id="it_comes_packag">It comes packaged with a simple-to-use open source DNA annotation program, GENtle 2.0 beta, to help assemble your newly designed constructs. After uploading your sequence file, annotation is performed through a series of straightforward dropdown menus. The most useful functions, such as restriction digest mapping, are already preloaded. Files can then either be exported in a variety of formats, such as FASTA, or saved within the Synbiota.ca server for your teammates to see.</p>
<p id="synbiota_has_se">Synbiota has several registration options. In the free plan, you can have one collaborator share a notebook and have an unlimited number of public projects ongoing that can be viewed by anyone accessing Synbiota, along with one private project that only you and your teammate will have access to.  All options also give users unlimited use of the open source DNA annotation tool, GENtle 2.0. Higher levels of access operate on a sliding payment scale, allowing up to 15 additional collaborators and 5 private projects.</p>
<p id="according_to_ka">According to Katty Wu, a rising senior at Stuyvesant High School who is currently using the site during a summer research project here at our community biotech lab, Genspace:</p>
<table style="border: 0; " class="simplelist"><tr><td>…Synbiota has been a very user-friendly tool to help organize the team's lab notebook. It's simple to use and the sidebar is a great way to navigate through all our entries. It has allowed me to easily communicate a day's work at lab with my mentors and lab colleagues…The service is extremely friendly and really values my opinions and problems. It's a site which allows starting research scientists, as well as experienced ones, to cooperate on an online environment knowing that someone's always got their back.</td></tr></table>
<p id="the_site_is_sti">The site is still in beta mode, so bugs are to be expected, and new features can be added, such as a calendar to keep track of projects. I’ve emailed these and other suggestions to Connor Dickie (<code class="email">&lt;<a class="email" href="mailto:connor@synbiota.ca">connor@synbiota.ca</a>&gt;</code>), cofounder and CEO of Synbiota, Inc. Throughout this summer, our students have had very fast and positive responses from Connor and his development team, Justin Pahara and Kevin Chen.</p>
<p id="currently_wher">Currently, where Synbiota stands out is in allowing groups of students, scientists, and engineers to quickly get started using an ELN for data sharing. Uploading data is made easy through a minimalist interface that breaks everything down into four categories:  Notes, Experiments, Protocols, and Literature. Having mentored four IGEM teams, I can attest to the difficulties in having students share lab notes with one another when they may be operating on different schedules. Having the information online just makes so much sense. Using a system such as Synbiota also expedites uploading of content to other sites, such as in a competition, or for eventual publication. In the end, you will have to transcribe your notebook into an electronic format anyway, so this is a great way to start getting used to the process. It also readily permits mentors to check on progress. So if you’re either new to the world of ELNs or if you have a boisterous team of students to manage on a cloning project, I would definitely recommend that you give Synbiota a shot.

<p id="bioprinting_is_">Bioprinting is printing with biological materials. Think of it as 3D printing, but with squishier ingredients. There’s a lot of work being done at research labs and big companies like Organovo on 3D printing of human tissues for drug testing, or even of whole human organs for transplantation. But the basic underlying technologies are surprisingly accessible: it’s all based on inkjet printing or 3D printing—technologies that are readily available to the DIY scientist.</p>

<p id="when_we_first_o">When we first opened the doors on the BioCurious lab in Sunnyvale, we wanted to pick a couple of community projects around which we could build a critical mass—ideally projects that weren’t purely limited to the wetlab, so we could have newcomers walk in the door and start participating right away. Bioprinting seemed to fit the bill. Over the course of about a year, meeting once a week with a constantly changing set of participants, we actually managed to put together a rudimentary printer that could print E. coli cells onto an agar plate using an XY platform built from parts scavenged from old CD drives and an inkjet printhead.

<p id="none_of_this_wo">None of this would have been possible even five years ago. The idea to use CD drive stepper motors was borrowed from another DIYbio group, Hackteria, in Europe; the InkShield driving the print head is an Open Hardware project originally funded on Kickstarter; the InkShield and stepper motors are controlled by an Arduino; and some of the acrylic was laser cut at TechShop. None of that whole amazing infrastructure was around just a few years back.</p>
<p id="so_now_that_we_">So now that we actually had a working artefact, we needed a way to share it with the wider DIYbio community. But how do you publish your achievements in DIYbio? Some might have gone with a github repository. We decided to write a detailed description on the Instructables website, which seemed a better fit for a project how-to with lots of pictures. You can find that Instructable at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.instructables.com/id/DIY-BioPrinter" target="_top">http://www.instructables.com/id/DIY-BioPrinter</a>. Ironically, our $150 DIY BioPrinter Instructable won two contests on the Instructables website, winning us a $1500 Macbook Pro and a $1500 UP! 3D printer—a 20× rate of return!</p>
<p id="so_what_do_you_">So what do you do with a DIY BioPrinter? Make yourself a DIY organ transplant? Not likely. Animal cells are a pain to maintain in a community lab. And human cells pose a biosafety risk, since you’re growing cells without an immune system that can catch whatever nasty bugs you’re carrying and spread them to other people. So rather than compete with the multimillion dollar biomedical applications that industry is pursuing, at BioCurious, we’ve decided to strike out into a direction where we have almost zero competition: instead of trying to print human organs, why not try…plant organs? Specifically, we’d love to print a synthetic leaf and get it to photosynthesize. The reaction we get to that idea is usually "Wow, cool!" And <span class="emphasis"><em>that</em></span> is exactly why we’re doing it. As DIY biohackers on a shoestring budget, we don’t need to ask ourselves who’s going to fund our research, or what commercial applications it might have—after all, there aren’t too many plants desperately in need of a leaf transplant. But anything we accomplish in bioprinting with plant cells will be novel and publishable. And heck, we’ll probably stumble across something with commercial possibilities, but that’s not our primary motivation.</p>
<p id="our_original_bi">Our original BioPrinter instructable made quite a splash, with articles in <a class="ulink" href="http://www.wired.com/design/2013/01/diy-bio-printer/" target="_top">Wired</a>, <a class="ulink" href="http://www.technologyreview.com/view/511436/a-diy-bioprinter-is-born/" target="_top">MIT Technology Review</a>, <a class="ulink" href="http://blog.makezine.com/2013/04/19/how-to-diy-bioprinter/" target="_top">Makezine</a>, and a bunch of major tech blogs. We know of several groups that are building their own BioPrinter based on our example, including at least two academic labs that are planning to use it as an actual research platform. (Can you autoclave an inkjet cartridge? Only one way to find out…) The week after we published our instructable, Nicolas Lewis, the designer of the InkShield driving our inkjet print head, ran out of stock and had to start production on a new batch of InkShields.</p>
<p id="would_we_build_">Would we build the same BioPrinter with scavenged parts if we had to do things over again? Probably not. It was a wonderful learning opportunity for us, especially considering none of us in the BioPrinter group had any experience with bioprinting, and hardly any of us knew anything about inkjet technology, Arduinos, laser cutting, stepper motors, or how to drive stepper motors. We all taught each other what little pieces we knew, and we managed to pull off something incredibly cool. I would still recommend our current design as a learning tool that can be built on an incredibly small budget. But it definitely has its limitations: it’s only an XY platform, and adding a Z stage may be problematic given the low-power CD drive stepper motors. And using an inkjet cartridge as a print head means you can only print with liquid cultures that have the consistence of inkjet ink.</p>
<p id="our_further_har">Our further hardware developments since the instructable have focused on three areas:</p>
<div class="orderedlist" id="replacing_the_c_id1"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1">
<li class="listitem">
Replacing the cobbled-together stepper motor drivers on our old BioPrinter with a RAMPS shield, which is the electronic of choice for the 3D printing community these days
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Adding a bioprinting head onto the brand-new 3D printer we won (people starting from scratch may want to look at some of the very cheap 3D printer models coming out now, like the $200 MakiBox, to use as a dedicated bioprinting platform!)
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Replacing the inkjet print head with a set of syringe pumps
</li>
</ol></div>
<p id="below_is_a_diy_">Below is a DIY syringe pump we threw together: just a $10 linear stepper motor, pushing directly on the plunger of a small-diameter disposable syringe. It works great, at a cost that is a couple orders of magnitude less than professional syringe pumps.</p>

<div class="figure-title">Figure 8-3. Under construction: a $10 DIY syringe pump, capable of delivering 0.5ul/step</div>
</div>
<p id="the_syringe_pum">The syringe pumps should allow us to print using gels that maintain their shape, enabling 3D prints. Or perhaps better: print using sodium alginate and cells in one syringe and calcium chloride in a second. Where the two come in contact, the alginate will solidify, trapping the cells in a biocompatible matrix. Now imagine what crazy things you could do with cells that are engineered to express alginase under specific conditions so they can resculpt the 3D matrix that holds them in place. Add in some cell-to-cell communication, chemotaxis, and bacterial cellulose biosynthesis pathways, and you have yourself a complete toolbox for 3D pattern formation. The possibilities are endless.</p>

<p id="we_are_not_what">We are not what we think we are.</p>
<p id="that_thought_ha">That thought has been reverberating in my mind for many years now. As we learn more and more about ourselves, what was once classified as "junk" DNA turns out to function as gene switches, controlling facial features and likely much more. Also, our genome is filled with viral DNA, and from just what we can recognize, we have about 100,000 fragments. At least 8% of our genome is viral (we are already GMOs) and "we" are outnumbered by at least 10x by the bacterial cells that reside on and in the human body.</p>
<p id="so_what_is_huma">So what is humanity? We are biotech; we’re only just now realizing the extent to which we’ve been altered by the biology around us.</p>
<p id="i_felt_the_titl">I felt the title of this article was apt, as Kevin Kelly once wrote about how technology (and biological evolution) drove and continues to drive <span class="emphasis"><em>Homo sapiens</em></span> development. Kelly calls that driving force the <span class="emphasis"><em>technium</em></span>, a word designated to signify the greater global and massively interconnected system of technology vibrating around us.</p>
<p id="biotech_wants_u">Biotech wants us. It wants us to continue the path that it has started us down, changing our fundamental genetic code and adding, manipulating, and testing genes to alter ourselves and the biology all around us. It wants us to quicken the pace of change with tools evolution has already provided us with, such as the basic tools we need to cut and manipulate DNA, the source code of life. Biotech wants us to embrace it with both hands!</p>
<p id="so_whats_next_">So what’s next in biotech, and what are our tributaries? One of the best and easiest to understand classifications of biotech is based on the rainbow code of biotech. It states:</p>

Agricultural biotech isn’t about just your run-of-the-mill soybean genetically modified organism (GMO), but drought-resistant crops, micropropagation of different plant varieties, tools for identifying the best plants through molecular fingerprinting, and novel breeding methods (including double haploids and increased chromosome numbers). AgBio has the potential to support both current and novel needs for food, energy, and materials as humanity grows from 7 to 10 billion people.

 Nutritional biotech is one of the oldest forms of biotech. It has been used to fortify foods through fermentation, creating wine, beer, cheeses, breads, and other more nutritious foods through the use of enzymes, microbes, and fungi. Many of the techniques used to create today’s foods—including one of my personal favorites, sourdough bread, which was likely created in ancient Egypt and was the primary food source of marching Roman soldiers due to its nutritional content—have played a vital role in nourishing most larger human civilizations. Innovation potential in this space is still vast for new foods, flavors, and fortifications!

<p id="medicine_and_hu" class="simpara">
Medicine and human health, the area with which I’m most familiar, has been transformative for human health and wellness, contrary to many of the bunk science claims that anti-vaccine campaigners tout. Just in the United States, vaccines have eradicated measles, diphtheria, mumps, smallpox, and polio. Measles alone once had 500,000 yearly cases; now that number is nearly zero.
</p>
<p id="antibiotics_hav" class="simpara">Antibiotics have been revolutionary. According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), "In 1900, the three leading causes of death were pneumonia, tuberculosis (TB), and diarrhea and enteritis, which (together with diphtheria) caused one third of all deaths." Forty percent of those deaths were in children under the age of five. Imagine that! Red biotech has been an overwhelming success, even making massive strides in treating and delaying diseases often associated with old age. These diseases, too, will fall to science as the power of our tools and our understanding of both genomics and human biology increases. With the announcement of Calico, a Google-backed startup aimed to <span class="keep-together">combat</span> aging-related disease, and Human Longevity Inc., formed by J. Craig Venter with the aim of sequencing and unraveling the meaning of 100k genomes per year, the race to fix the aging human body from a data-driven perspective is now beginning in earnest.</p>

Industrial biotechnology is a rapidly evolving space. One of the trendy new terms people have been using for industrial bio is "synthetic biology." I have to admit, I’m not really a fan. Synbio is just a new buzzword that some investors seem to be falling in love with, but the trends in industrial bio are very real and have immense potential!
</p>
<p id="this_sector_inc" class="simpara">This sector includes the replacement of standard industrial processes with biotech processes to create pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, food additives, chemicals, fuels, enzymes, and other materials. In many cases, this results in a decrease in the overall cost of production and increased availability of products that are harder to synthesize or refine. Two fascinating examples of industrial biotech companies moving this field forward are Plantic, which produces biopolymers and plastics based on corn, and Novozymes, which makes many of the enzymes used in laundry detergents, automatic dishwashing machines, and the food and beverage industry.</p>

We encourage you to send us questions, ideas, and topics you would like to see covered in this series.</p>
</div>
<p id="in_the__fil">In the 1970 film <span class="emphasis"><em>Tora! Tora! Tora!</em></span>, Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto exclaims, "I fear all we have done is to awaken a sleeping giant and fill him with a terrible resolve." This was in response to the successful 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor by forces of Imperial Japan.  In spring 2013, a small project listed on Kickstarter that was part of the larger DIYbio movement awoke the US regulatory system with a dimly lit glowing plant.  On May 7, 2013, <span class="emphasis"><em>The New York Times</em></span> published <a class="ulink" href="http://nyti.ms/1gWvrAH" target="_top">"A Dream of Trees Aglow at Night"</a>, which exposed those not paying attention to the power of crowd funding and the possibilities, albeit even with a novelty product, of biotechnology and the DIYbio movement. As I opened the door to my office that morning, my phone was already blinking, the first message from a US Senator’s office wanting to know how this type of product could escape regulatory oversight. As I hopped in a cab on my way up to Capitol Hill to brief the Senator’s staff, all I could think about was the quote from Admiral Yamamoto. Glowing Plant’s ability to raise half a million dollars in such a short period of time and the perception that there was no oversight of the first release of a genetically engineered seed produced by “amateurs” caught the government off guard. The swift and immediate reaction from the Hill gave me the sense that the “sleeping giant” had been awoken.</p>
<p id="our_conversatio">Our conversation was based on how a project like Glowing Plant was perceived to have escaped regulatory oversight and whether the <a class="ulink" href="http://1.usa.gov/1j86OYF" target="_top">Coordinated Framework</a>, a regulation written in the mid-1980s, was capable of dealing with applications that could come out of the DIYbio movement. Established as a formal policy in 1986, the Coordinated Framework for Regulation of Biotechnology describes the federal system for evaluating products developed using modern biotechnology. It established which federal agencies would have jurisdiction over a particular application in order to streamline the process for companies that could potentially fall under the jurisdiction of at least three federal agencies and no less than four federal laws: the Plant Protection Act; the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act; the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act; and the Toxic Substance Control Act. The three main federal agencies responsible for regulating the safe use of genetically engineered organisms are the US Department of Agriculture, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the US Department of Health and Human Services' Food and Drug Administration (FDA). As the ability to manipulate and design new organisms rapidly evolves, debates on whether the coordinated framework is suitable to regulate the changing face of biotechnology should continue. However, the issue around Glowing Plant is not whether the process it is going to use is <a class="ulink" href="http://bit.ly/1gf0HzD" target="_top">regulated or not</a>, but whether the government and general public are comfortable with “amateurs” being able to use these techniques.  Glowing Plant challenges the status quo in a number of ways.  First, it showed how a research project could be funded outside the traditional funding methods, how democratized access to biotechnology techniques could spur a new company with thousands of supporters, and how a project/product could be marketed and sold as an open source application. At the same time, it is challenging whether our governance structures can deal with fast-paced technologies, particularly when it comes to environmental release from products produced outside the traditional biotechnology industry.</p>

However, it also shines a brighter light on the community, which could increase scrutiny from regulatory agencies and exacerbate the <a class="ulink" href="http://bit.ly/1oAiRgo" target="_top">myths</a> that surround the DIYbio community. The movement is going to have to engage with those in the federal government if it wants to avoid knee-jerk regulatory actions based on misinformation and conjecture from a segment within the government that believes placing biology in the hands of the public is too dangerous and that the movement has nothing to contribute beyond becoming the next biosecurity threat. Anyone tinkering with and experimenting with biology raises legitimate biosecurity, biosafety, and environmental concerns. As the movement becomes more sophisticated in its scientific abilities, these concerns will continue to grow and the community should continue to address and adapt to these apprehensions.</p>
<p id="the_diybio_move">The DIYbio movement, and the larger citizen science movement, presents an interesting dichotomy for the US government.  On the one hand, it wants to <a class="ulink" href="http://1.usa.gov/PUiGku" target="_top">support the movement</a> in order to promote innovation; on the other hand, there are legitimate biosecurity, biosafety, and environmental concerns that raise public policy and public perception issues. Like it or not, the community has a spotlight on it, and while the movement has its supporters within the government, there are those who are looking for ways to limit its ability to flourish and, in some instances, shut it down completely. By engaging directly with the government, the community can build supporters, adapt to their concerns early, and control the narrative around DIYbio.</p>

<div><h1 class="title">Chapter 3. DIYbio and Human Subjects Research</h1></div>
<div><div class="author"><h3 class="author"><span class="othername">Michael Scroggins</span></h3></div></div>
</div></div>
<p id="in_what_follows">In what follows, I am going to float a thought balloon: DIYbio laboratories should think through their relationships with Title 45 Code of Federal Regulations Part 46, informally known as the <a class="ulink" href="http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/humansubjects/commonrule/" target="_top">"Common Rule"</a>, which establishes the existence of institutional review boards (IRBs) for research involving human subjects. I think there are two related reasons for doing so.</p>
<p id="first_diybio_i">First, DIYbio is quickly pushing into research involving human subjects. The <a class="ulink" href="http://getitproject.org/" target="_top">GETit Project</a> and the <a class="ulink" href="http://www.immunityproject.org/" target="_top">Immunity Project</a> point to medical clinical research as an emerging direction for DIYbio research, and certainly there are others in the planning stage. This is not surprising, given that biology is an unusually broad discipline and DIYbio is more than just an amateur version of synthetic biology, even though it is often portrayed as such.</p>
<p id="but_medical_and">But medical and clinical research is a field with a long and complicated history that warrants caution. Scientists have experimented on themselves and those close to them since time immemorial. Jonas Salk, for instance, <a class="ulink" href="http://www.jonas-salk.org/docs/InterviewFAQ.html" target="_top">first tested his polio vaccine on himself</a>, then on his family, then on children at the Watson Home for Crippled Children in Sewickley, PA, then on residents of Sewickley, and then on a few traveling friends and family members. Beginning with his own body, Salk’s vaccine spread outward in an ever-expanding circle.</p>
<p id="in_contrast_to_">In contrast to Salk’s success, Stubbins Ffirth, an 18th-century medical apprentice, was convinced that yellow fever was not a contagious disease but rather the result of hot weather and bad temper. He "proved" his point by consuming bodily fluids produced by yellow fever patients. Luckily for Ffirth, the fluids came from patients who were no longer contagious and Ffirth survived his ill-considered <span class="keep-together">experiment</span>.<a href="#ftn.id385916" class="footnote"><sup class="footnote" id="id385916">[1]</sup></a> Unsurprisingly, Ffirth was unable to convince others to join in his experiment, leaving his a lonely circle. But, experimentation on the self and those physically and emotionally close remains at least a constant possibility, if not normal practice. Even the BioCurious motto, "Experiment with Friends," points to the ubiquity of this idea.</p>
<p id="but_there_is_a_">But there is a power discrepancy at work here. Salk and his colleagues may have understood the risks of his polio vaccine (though it is certain that Ffirth did not understand the risks of eating infected vomit), but it is less likely that Salk’s family understood the risks and even less certain that the children at the Watson Home or their parents understood the risks. An IRB, in the broadest sense, is intended to protect both Ffirth from himself and Salk’s family and the children of the Watson Home from Salk’s enthusiasm by ensuring that everyone involved in biomedical or psychological research is fully informed about the possibility of risks and rewards at each step of the research process.</p>
<p id="so_the_irb_was">So, the IRB was established because of very real abuses in the power discrepancy between researcher and researched. The worst abuses were perpetrated by Nazi medical experiments, which led to the Nuremberg Code. But there have been many abuses carried out by otherwise well meaning but overly enthusiastic researchers. The <a class="ulink" href="http://bit.ly/1eqry9Z" target="_top">Wikipedia page on unethical human experimentation in the United States</a> is very comprehensive on this point, so I will refer you there instead of recounting the numerous abuses here. But, keep in mind that most of the experimenters listed set out with the best of intentions.</p>
<div class="sect1" data-original-filename="DIYBio-and-Human-Subjects-Research.asciidoc" id="_for_profit_irbs">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title">For-Profit IRBs</h2></div></div></div>
<p id="second_the_rec">Second, the recent rise of for-profit IRBs to prominence has undercut the ethical purpose of the IRB in two ways: first, by allowing IRB shopping, and second, by creating a market incentive to green-light research that would not otherwise pass. If one IRB rejects a study for being too risky,  then it is a simple matter of paying another company to review the proposal until one that will green-light the project is found. The problems with for-profit IRBs have been written about in both <a class="ulink" href="http://bit.ly/1jc77NV" target="_top">PLOS</a> and <a class="ulink" href="http://bit.ly/1ijB2EK" target="_top">The Lancet</a>, in addition to the popular press. Unlike institutional IRBs, for-profit boards have no oversight, and <span class="keep-together">conflicts</span> of interest involving IRB members and companies sponsoring the research before the IRB can be hidden behind the corporate veil.</p>
<p id="the_problems_wi">The problems with for-profit IRBs were exposed by a US Government Accountability Office (GAO) sting using the fake drug <a class="ulink" href="http://1.usa.gov/OB6uE7" target="_top">Adhesiabloc</a>. Briefly, Adhesiabloc was a fake product from a fake company produced by fake researchers. The research proposal was turned down by two for-profit IRBs, but approved by a third—Coast IRB. The fake proposal described a gel to be administered post-surgery into a patient’s abdominal cavity to reduce scarring by absorbing debris left after surgery. Adhesiabloc flew through the IRB process at Coast IRB, but it was not the only <a class="ulink" href="http://bit.ly/1oAsmfq" target="_top">fake research approved</a>. Mercifully, Coast IRB was forced to close after the GAO investigation.</p>
<p id="if_there_was_ev">If there was ever a process (other than the patent process) that could use openness and transparency, it is the IRB. An open source IRB process is possible and would bring some welcome transparency to an often opaque system. With DIYbio already heading quickly toward human subjects research and the world of for-profit IRBs offering expensive, if not objective, reviews, now is the time for DIYbio laboratories to carefully consider establishing a relationship with the Common Rule.</p>

</div></div>
<p id="both_synthetic_">Both synthetic biology and personal computing are informational sciences. They deal with the generation, storage, and transmission of information through the animate and the inanimate, respectively. At the conceptual level, the two are very similar. Surprisingly, the parallels do not end there. Just as personal computing has dramatically altered how we do things, synthetic biology is poised to revolutionize our world even further. The similarities include:</p>

Conceptual parallels
</span></dt>
<dd>
<p id="the_basic_unit_" class="simpara">
The basic unit of information in computing is a <span class="emphasis"><em>bit</em></span>, which exists in only two forms: 0 or 1. In synthetic biology, it is the four nucleotide bases in the DNA. Accounting for the four nucleotides as pairs of bits—00, 01, 10, and 11—the whole human DNA can be written in just 756 MB. Proteins and genes can easily be compared to transistors and diodes as the determinants of the state of a particular reaction or passage of current. DNA repair mechanisms are similar to the error protection measures in computing. Biological data is compressed using overlapping open reading frames (ORFs). Biochemical reactions are like logic gates that use binary operations to deduce the functioning of biochemical pathways.
</p>
<p id="ribosomes_cell" class="simpara">Ribosomes, cells, and whole tissues are increasingly being seen as operating systems, computers, and networks, which many are now tinkering with in university labs and hacker spaces. Computer programmers have taken inspiration from biology, as is evident by the development of neural networks, evolutionary selection of possible solutions, and the addition of robustness into their systems. It is time that biologists learned a few methodologies from their fellow information scientists, and some have already embarked on that process. The highly ambitious goals include writing entirely original code and developing new computers that run on similar or advanced operating systems. And by this I mean engineering novel proteins and creating new life forms similar to the ones we know—and possibly some less familiar ones, too.</p>

Historical parallels
</span></dt>
<dd>
<p id="computers_were_" class="simpara">
Computers were initially viewed as calculating giants that only large corporations, the government, or the military possessed. They became personal only in the 1980s. The two companies responsible for the paradigm shift—Apple and Microsoft—were born not out of academia or industrial establishments, but in the garages of DIY enthusiasts. Biological research has long been, and mostly still is, confined to universities and multinational institutions. In what could be a historical shift in the field, DIY biologists have sprung up over the last decade and are bringing the very same element to biology that the DIY home computer builders brought to computing. Partly, this was made possible by the ever-dropping prices of DNA sequencing and synthesis and the development of low-cost hardware.
</p>
<p id="the_key_element" class="simpara">The key elements include standardization of parts, ease of compilation, open sourcing of information (read hacker ethics), citizen involvement, and democratization of technology. It was only after these were incorporated in the garages of Silicon Valley that the computer could be placed on the desks and later in the pockets of the people. In addition to the lack of these elements, the limitations with recombinant DNA technology are that the experiments take too long and that the results are too complex to easily interpret. Synthetic biology aims to tackle these challenges and its mission can be, in my humble view, best defined as bringing engineering back into genetic engineering.</p>

Futuristic parallels
</span></dt>
<dd>
<p id="according_to_so" class="simpara">
According to some estimates, the number of mobile phones will soon surpass the number of people in the world. Computers are everywhere, and so are people who understand a thing or two about them. Teens make apps at home and start companies out of them. Nothing has ever been this personal and intuitive. Is synthetic biology following suit? What does it have to offer?
</p>
<p id="just_as_anyone_" class="simpara">Just as anyone can learn to program, soon designing synthetic life "will be commonplace." Similar to the parallels synthetic biology has to personal computing, personal genome sequencing might lead to the engineering of systems to print customized therapeutic small molecules. But synthetic biology, specifically, has the potential to be even more revolutionary than personal computing, as it holds direct influence on the world’s largest industries, namely pharmaceuticals, energy, food, warfare, and manufacturing.</p>

<div><h1 class="title">Chapter 5. Biotechnology Must Head for the Cloud</h1></div>
<div><div class="author"><h3 class="author"><span class="othername">Sajith Wickramasekara</span></h3></div></div>
</div></div>
<p id="its_clear_that">It’s clear that the rate of hardware innovation in life science is staggering. Illumina recently made headlines by announcing it had <a class="ulink" href="http://bit.ly/OEPsEL%5D" target="_top">dropped the cost of sequencing one human genome to a mere $1,000</a>. While this cost excludes the much greater costs associated with data analysis and interpretation, it’s still a remarkable milestone considering that the first human genome cost $3 billion to sequence just over a decade ago. That’s a 3,000,000x improvement.</p>
<p id="in_contrast_th">In contrast, the state of software is unacceptable and progressing much more slowly. How many scientists do you know who use spreadsheets to organize DNA? Or who collaborate by emailing files around? Or who can’t actually search their colleagues’ sequence data? If synthetic biology is going to reimagine genetic engineering, it won’t be on the foundation of archaic software tools.</p>
<p id="we_need_a_cloud">We need a cloud-based platform for scientific research, designed from the ground up for collaboration. Legacy desktop software has compounded systemic problems in science: poor scientific reproducibility, delayed access to new computational techniques, and rampant IT overhead. These issues are a thorn in the side of all scientists, and it’s our responsibility to fix them if we want to accelerate <span class="keep-together">science</span>.</p>
<div class="sect1" data-original-filename="Biotechnology-must-head-for-the-clouds.asciidoc" id="_reproducibility">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title">Reproducibility</h2></div></div></div>
<p id="the_reproducibi">The reproducibility of peer-reviewed research is currently under fire. Scientists at Amgen tried to reproduce 53 landmark cancer studies, only to find that all but 6 <a class="ulink" href="http://bit.ly/1g57n2y" target="_top">could not be confirmed</a>. Many journals do not have strict guidelines for publishing all datasets associated with a project.</p>
<p id="just_as_in_life">Just as in life science, computer scientists care about peer-reviewed research. However, a powerful prestige economy exists around creating and maintaining open source software. If you release broken software, people will say something and contribute fixes. This feedback loop is broken in biology. It can take months for journals to accept corrections, and spotting flaws is incredibly difficult without access to all of the project materials.</p>
<p id="replicating_thi">Replicating this prestige economy around practical, usable output requires a culture shift. Nonetheless, that doesn’t mean we can’t facilitate the process. Preparing a manuscript for publication is tedious and time-consuming. Thus, there’s little incentive for scientists to expend additional effort preparing and hosting project materials online after the fact. Files need to be wrangled from collaborators, data needs to be hosted and maintained indefinitely, and code used in data analysis needs to be documented. This process of "open-sourcing" a project must be as frictionless as flipping a switch.</p>
<p id="the_solution_li">The solution lies upstream with the software we use to actually do the work. Imagine that you plan your experiments in silico, using specialized applications for working with each type of biological data that talk to a central project repository in the cloud. Each bit of incremental progress is tracked and versioned so at any point you can jump back in time and replay your work. As you run your experiments, the hardware talks to the cloud applications in which the experiments were designed, enabling easier analysis of the results and passive note-taking that is far more comprehensive and accurate than using a lab notebook. You give your collaborators access to the online project from day one, allowing them to quickly offer suggestions and speed up research cycles. When it comes time to publish, you simply mark your project as public instead of private, and the community immediately has access to all of the work that led to your results.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect1" data-original-filename="Biotechnology-must-head-for-the-clouds.asciidoc" id="_access_to_new_computational_techniques">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title">Access to New Computational Techniques</h2></div></div></div>
<p id="another_major_p">Another major problem is the speed at which the latest computational techniques are disseminated. New versions of desktop software are often released on a yearly basis due to the overhead involved in developing patches and getting them installed. The upgrades are often tied to expensive license renewals, which slows uptake further. For a quickly developing field like synthetic biology, the algorithms and methods change too quickly for traditional desktop software to keep up. With web-based software, developers can easily push updates multiple times per day without any user intervention. This results in scientists getting access to cutting-edge tools without any inconvenience.</p>
<p id="more_importantl">More importantly, a cloud solution would prevent the need to reinvent the wheel for each new computational technique. Imagine you devise a new algorithm for aligning DNA sequences. Any small script you write that does some data processing or analysis should not require you to go through the trouble of making sure it runs properly on your colleagues’ machines. On the other hand, hosting a tool by yourself that other scientists could use would require creating your own data storage, visualization, and serving infrastructure. A shared cloud platform would provide web APIs that provide this functionality, allowing anyone with basic programming skills to develop new tools for the community.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect1" data-original-filename="Biotechnology-must-head-for-the-clouds.asciidoc" id="_it_overhead">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title">IT Overhead</h2></div></div></div>
<p id="for_biologists_">For biologists who understand that easy access to their colleagues’ data facilitates more productive collaboration, the only option is often to develop a one-off database for their organization to use. Some existing products offer expensive shared database solutions, but they still require a scientific lab to obtain and maintain its own machines for running the software. The cloud should be leveraged to offer managed solutions for shared databases of biological data. Rather than having to run their own database infrastructure, scientists should be able to upload their data to an existing cloud repository, where it can be organized, searched, and quickly shared with collaborators around the world. IT will never be biologists’ core competency, and moving their data from servers in their labs to the cloud would let them focus on doing biology.</p>
<p id="the_benefits_of">The benefits of the cloud in reducing IT overhead are even clearer in “big data” applications. In many cases, biologists could clearly benefit by applying cloud technologies that the tech world has been developing for a decade. It seems ridiculous that, although bioinformatics is dependent upon having large datasets for cross-reference, simple cloud storage solutions providing easy contribution and access are not adequately used. Even when this data is available, biologists still use expensive supercomputing clusters, failing to take advantage of modern distributed techniques that make commodity hardware just as powerful. Although price may not be a significant issue for top-tier labs, the democratizing effect of cloud solutions would enable new ideas to come from anywhere. Furthermore, too many biologists are still unable to use big data because they aren’t adept programmers. Cloud infrastructure could abstract away the complexity of large-scale data processing, allowing them to write simple, high-level scripts and queries that provide insight into massive datasets.</p>

<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title">The Road Forward</h2></div></div></div>
<p id="a_few_colleague">A few colleagues and I were so fed up with the quality of software used in the life sciences from personal experience in research labs that we set out to solve this problem ourselves. We’ve made it our mission to build beautiful tools for scientists that are easy to use and take the pain out of managing and sharing biological data. Our solution is called Benchling and is currently focused on DNA. We offer a free version of our software to academics and biohackers, so I encourage you to check it out at <a class="ulink" href="https://benchling.com" target="_top">https://benchling.com</a>. Thousands of scientists are already using it to design, analyze, and share DNA, so you’re in good company.</p>
<p id="software_tends_">Software tends to be an afterthought in biotechnology. It’s time to recognize that as scientists, whether you are a biohacker in a garage or work on a team with hundreds of scientists, you should be demanding better web-based software tools that enable collaboration and data sharing. The cloud is quickly replacing desktop software in other fields, and it provides clear benefits that should make biology no different.</p>

<p id="biomimicry_is_t">Biomimicry is the design and production of materials, structures, and systems that are modeled on <a class="ulink" href="https://www.google.com/#q=what+is+biomimicry" target="_top">biological entities and processes</a>. For about 50 years now, scientists and engineers in the relatively young engineering field of <a class="ulink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomimicry" target="_top">biomimicry</a> have been formally copying nature’s models to improve existing machines and innovate new products.

<p id="biomimicry_is_n">Biomimicry is not normally associated with the DIYbio community, as it is principally the domain of <a class="ulink" href="http://www.asknature.org/" target="_top">multimillion-dollar corporations and military research</a> for aiding war efforts. Still, my honest endeavor to empower as many designers, programmers, and bio artists through biomimicry as possible has initially been well received in <a class="ulink" href="http://slidesha.re/1jcjSrH" target="_top">web conferences around the world</a>.</p>
<p id="natures_managi">Nature’s managing of complexity and achieving of harmony can be understood with mathematical formulas beneath complicated systems. These processes have been extracted into <a class="ulink" href="http://to.pbs.org/NxE5xB" target="_top">mathematical proportions and patterns</a> such as the Fibonacci sequence, and I dare to demonstrate its application to digital design and web programming much as scientists and engineers do with complex engineering solutions from the natural world.</p>
<p id="when_artists_an">When artists and designers look at nature, it’s easy for them to get hung up on aesthetics. However, given the recent demand for designers to learn to program, it is now more desirable to use nature’s code as expressed in mathematical arrays. Artists and designers can start by extracting “design thinking” from nature’s cycles, letting that information affect the creative process, and taking chances. Ultimately, artists, designers, and programmers can make their own personal connections with <span class="keep-together">nature</span>.</p>

<p id="a_typical_biolo">A typical biology lab is filled with dozens of machines that each function independently. Our goal is to find ways for the machines to interoperate. In this article, we will demonstrate how to create simple electronic interfaces for different kinds of devices so that they can be controlled and coordinated by a computer.</p>
<p id="hacking_traditi">Hacking traditional lab equipment provides a way to incrementally introduce automation into your workflow. You do not need to clear out space for a large, expensive robot that might be more cumbersome than useful. You can gradually add more automation in a way that coexists with manual processes.</p>
<p id="automation_has_">Automation has the potential to improve reproducibility by increasing procedural precision and providing new experimental capacity that can be allocated to validating previous results. However, the form of automation is important: an experiment designed around a $200,000 robot may not be easy for an outsider to reproduce. Instead we propose to create experiments designed around the automation of commodity hardware.</p>
<p id="for_this_approa">For this approach to improve reproducibility, we will need good documentation. We should support equipment manufacturers that provide easy-to-use, easy-to-hack electrical and software interfaces suitable for automation. Open equipment documentation will become an important component of open science.</p>
<div class="sect1" data-original-filename="Hacking-Lab-Equipment.asciidoc" id="_our_approach">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title">Our Approach</h2></div></div></div>
<p id="we_will_take_a_">We will take a do-it-yourself, but not do-everything-yourself approach. If we spend all our time building equipment, we won’t have time to use the equipment, so rather than building devices from scratch, we’ll modify standard lab equipment. (If you’d like to build your own lab equipment from scratch, check out <a class="ulink" href="http://www.teklalabs.org/" target="_top">Tekla Labs</a>.)</p>
<p id="we_wont_yet_ad">We won’t yet address a big part of lab automation: liquid handling. A computer-controlled centrifuge isn’t going to do much good unless you load something into it. An automatic pipettor isn’t very useful if it is stationary. We’ll cover liquid handling in another article.</p>
<p id="even_without_li">Even without liquid movement, hacking these devices can be useful. You can have your computer keep a log of the parameters for every centrifuge run. You can make a semiautomated system that alternates between machine actions and human actions. You can create a computerized lab partner that guides you through a complex procedure so that the results are more consistent.</p>
<p id="even_focusing_o">Even focusing on hacking traditional lab equipment, we can consider several approaches:</p>
<div class="orderedlist" id="using_servos_or_id1"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1">
<li class="listitem">
Using servos or other actuators to turn knobs and push buttons (this is safer than other approaches because we don’t need to modify equipment internals, but engineering reliable mechanical connections is difficult)
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Replacing the buttons and knobs with electrically controlled devices (relays, digital potentiometers)
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Replacing the entire control system with a new control system, only keeping the mechanical components
</li>
</ol></div>
<p id="we_choose_optio">We choose option 2, since it requires the least engineering work. With sufficient care, it can be reliable and reversible.</p>
</div>

<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title">Safety</h2></div></div></div>
<p id="these_projects_">These projects will probably void your warranties and could quite possibly destroy your equipment. You could electrocute yourself or burn down your lab building.</p>
<p id="make_sure_the_e">Make sure the equipment is unplugged before you open it. Even then, proceed with caution;
unplugged electronics may still hold a dangerous charge.</p>
<p id="if_you_buy_used">If you buy used equipment, you should consider the possibility that it is biologically or chemically contaminated. These machines are generally not autoclavable, though some may have autoclavable components.</p>

<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title">Getting Started</h2></div></div></div>
<p id="we_assume_that_">We assume that you have a soldering iron, a multimeter, and a microcontroller such as the Arduino. You can find many tutorials for these tools online.</p>
<p id="the_grove_syste">The Grove system by Seeed Studio includes various sensors and other components that can be easily attached to an Arduino. Grove devices connect with a four-conductor cable that provides power (typically 5V), ground, and two data lines. For expediency, we’ll use a combination of the Grove system and breadboarding, but the Grove system is not required; all of these circuits can be built using only wires and bare components.</p>

<div class="sect1" data-original-filename="Hacking-Lab-Equipment.asciidoc" id="_hacking_a_centrifuge">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title">Hacking a Centrifuge</h2></div></div></div>
<p id="the_revolutiona">The Revolutionary Science RS-102 is a simple, inexpensive centrifuge. A rotary switch selects between four modes: off, pulse, 6,000 RPM, and 10,000 RPM. The pulse mode will run at 10,000 RPM as long as the switch is held in that position.</p>
<p id="inside_the_mach">Inside the machine, you’ll find a large motor and a circuit board attached to the rotary switch. Use a screwdriver to pry off the switch cover. Remove the screws behind the cover to free the circuit board.</p>
<p id="number_the_swit">Number the switch terminals 1 to 4 in clockwise order when looking at the front of the switch (<a class="xref" href="ch07.html#fig7-1" title="Figure 7-1. We connect wires to the centrifuge control switch so that it can be activated using relays.">Figure 7-1</a>). Terminal 2 receives a rectified 120V AC input voltage. Terminal 3 is connected to the input when 6,000 RPM is selected. Terminals 1 and 4 are connected to the input when 10,000 RPM is selected. Solder wires to the terminals and connect them to a pair for relays. We’ll use standard Grove relays; they are rated to 15A at 120V. Make sure that your wire is also rated for this current and voltage and that the high-voltage connections to the relays are well insulated.</p>
<p id="use_digital_out">Use digital outputs from your microcontroller to activate the relays. One output will operate the centrifuge at 6,000 RPM and the other will operate it at 10,000 RPM. Activating both relays at once is not a problem; this will simply bypass the resistors used for the slower speed, resulting in 10,000 RPM operation. When both relays are off, the manual controls will operate normally.</p>

<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title">Hacking a Stir Plate</h2></div></div></div>
<p id="the_corning_pc">The Corning PC-420D is one of the most common stirring hot plates. It has two knobs on the front: one to control temperature and one to control stirring speed. Each knob also acts as an on/off switch. Inside you’ll find a few circuit boards and a motor. A metal plate on the motor functions both as a cooling fan and as part of an optical encoder that measures the speed of the motor.</p>
<p id="our_task_is_fai">Our task is fairly simple: we want to have a computer turn the knobs. Fortunately, the knob connections are easily accessible on one of the internal circuit boards. Each knob has five terminals: two operating as a switch and the other three as a standard potentiometer. We will replace each switch mechanism with a relay and each potentiometer with a digital potentiometer.</p>
<p id="viewing_the_boa">Viewing the board as shown in <a class="xref" href="ch07.html#fig7-2" title="Figure 7-2. Manual controls on a stirring hot plate are replaced with devices controlled by software.">Figure 7-2</a>, the left side of the potentiometer is low (ground) and the right side is high (about 3V). Remove the board and clip the middle lead on each potentiometer. (This can be reversed later by soldering.) Solder wires onto the back of the circuit board as shown.</p>
<div class="figure" id="fig7-2">
<div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="http://orm-chimera-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/1234000002013/images/bio3_0702.png" alt="Manual controls on a stirring hot plate are replaced with devices controlled by software."></div></div>
<div class="figure-title">Figure 7-2. Manual controls on a stirring hot plate are replaced with devices controlled by <span class="keep-together">software</span>.</div>
</div>
<p id="we_will_use_a_d">We will use a DS1803 dual digital potentiometer with a 10k ohm range. (The original potentiometers have a 1.3k ohm range, but we do not need a perfect match since they are acting as voltage dividers; in fact, we could probably use a digital-to-analog converter for this application.) Connect the physical potentiometer’s low, high, and wiper (middle) leads to the DS1803’s low, high, and wiper pins. Connect the GND, VCC, SDA, and SDL pins to the microcontroller (for example, using a Grove cable plugged into an <span class="mathphrase">${ I }^{ 2 }C$</span> port on a Grove shield). You will also need to tie the microcontroller ground to the low end of the potentiometers. Once fully connected, the microcontroller can send <span class="mathphrase">${ I }^{ 2 }C$</span> commands to the DS1803 to digitally turn the knobs. The original potentiometers are no longer functional.</p>
<p id="one_remaining_t">One remaining task is determining the relationship between potentiometer values and the RPM and temperature settings. Our approach is to manually test a set of key values and perform the corresponding mapping in software. Alternatively, you could decode values from the seven-segment displays or from the control <span class="keep-together">circuitry</span>.</p>

<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title">Hacking an Electronic Pipette</h2></div></div></div>
<p id="the_eppendorf_x">The Eppendorf Xplorer is a standard electronic pipette. It contains a small linear actuator that drives the pipette’s aspiration and dispensing. An LCD shows a menu system for changing the pipette volume and other parameters.</p>
<p id="to_automate_thi">To automate this device, we will have our microcontroller perform button presses. For simplicity, we use Grove relays to activate each button. Solid-state relays or transistors are reasonable alternatives. Unfortunately, the tip ejector is manual; it can be controlled electronically by adding an external linear actuator (for example, from Servo City).</p>
<p id="to_open_the_pip">To open the pipettor, first remove the tip ejection button, then carefully squeeze the sides to remove the front cover. Inside you will find two small push buttons corresponding to the up and down directions and two smaller buttons for the left and right options. Solder wires onto the up and down buttons as shown in <a class="xref" href="ch07.html#fig7-3" title="Figure 7-3. The buttons on an electronic pipette can be triggered using a microcontroller.">Figure 7-3</a>. Be careful that you don’t apply too much heat to the circuit board. Connect the wires to a pair of relays, each attached to a digital output from your <span class="keep-together">microcontroller</span>.</p>
<div class="figure" id="fig7-3">

<div class="figure-title">Figure 7-3. The buttons on an electronic pipette can be triggered using a microcontroller.</div>
</div>
<p id="the_up_and_down">The up and down buttons are sufficient for triggering the aspiration and dispensing actions. If you’d also like to set the capacity electronically, add relays for the left and right buttons. This will require that the microcontroller blindly navigate the menus.</p>
<p id="ideally_we_wou">Ideally, we would obtain feedback about the current settings rather than navigating blindly. One crazy option is using computer vision software and a camera pointed at the display. A better alternative would be direct control via the pipette’s USB port, a subject for future hacking.</p>

<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title">Conclusion</h2></div></div></div>
<p id="we_have_describ">We have described approaches that can be used to automate a variety of basic lab machines. Almost anything that is controlled by buttons and potentiometers (as opposed to mechanical levers or a computer) can be automated using these building blocks.</p>
<p id="to_apply_this_a">To apply this approach to other equipment, you’ll need to carefully determine the voltage and current levels for the original electronic controls and choose replacement electronics accordingly. Make sure that you understand the circuits before modifying them. Use a multimeter and visually follow circuit board traces. Always be especially cautious with high voltages.</p>
<p id="controlling_lab">Controlling lab devices is only one part of lab automation. You will likely want to add movement: loading plates, moving vials, and multi-location pipetting. You will also need software to control all of this. We’ll cover these topics in upcoming articles.</p>

<p id="this_was_suppos">This was supposed to have been a nice little article on barcoding mushrooms. There was a simple protocol, and lots of folks in the DIYbio community have done all sorts of barcoding so it should have just gone easily, right? Well, not really. Unlike debugging computer code, where everything is right there to see, when debugging biology there’s a whole lot of inference involved. So even though I don’t have a huge set of exciting mushroom barcoding results to share, I thought sharing my experiences so far might be of some general interest.</p>
<p id="this_story_star">This story starts back in October 2013 when <span class="emphasis"><em>BioCoder</em></span> contributor Noah Most (<a class="xref" href="ch09.html" title="Chapter 9. Interview with Ian Marcus of SynBio4All">Chapter 9</a>) was visiting Victoria, BC, Canada. I dragged him and my friend Andy around to a few of the mushroom shows that spring up in the fall in British Columbia. The goal was to take pieces of the mushrooms on the show tables, which had already been identified by experts, and do a genetic identification. This would result in one of three possibilities. First, the mushroom could exist in the barcoding database and agree with the expert identification. Yay, concordance! Second, the mushroom could exist in the database, but be different than what the expert identified. This would also be interesting. Finally, the mushroom could be absent from the barcoding database, meaning we could put it in! That’s the really fun part, when something I’ve discovered turns out to be new and adds to our shared pool of scientific knowledge.</p>
<p id="so_wheres_this">So where’s this barcoding database? And how does this all work? DNA barcoding is a process of using a predefined section of an organism’s DNA to identify it. Different kingdoms use different segments of DNA—the barcode region for animals is not the same for plants, which is not the same for bacteria. But in each case, the concept is the same. The barcoding region is an area of the genome that is not under evolutionary selection pressure, so over evolutionary time it is subject to random drift. This means that each species you want to identify will have random variations in the barcoding region. As more species are collected into the barcoding database, it becomes possible to construct a phylogenetic tree of the species based on genetic similarity. The <a class="ulink" href="http://www.barcodeoflife.org" target="_top">central place on the Web for DNA barcoding</a> covers a lot of things we’re not directly interested in for fungal barcoding, so we use a <a class="ulink" href="http://www.fungalbarcoding.org/" target="_top">more specific site</a>.</p>
<p id="one_of_the_firs">One of the first things that must be done in barcoding is to identify the set of primers that will be used. Since we want to use a small segment of the genome and not have to sequence more than we need to, the first step in barcoding is to extract that DNA from the fungal cells and amplify our barcoding region using polymerase chain reaction (PCR.) The primers determine which region it is that we will amplify. Originally choosing the primers in fungi took a lot of work and a lot of cross-species comparison. Through the process, a number of different barcoding regions were suggested. The most common barcoding region currently used is between locations ITS1 and ITS4, so we’ll use primers ITS1F and ITS4R to amplify our barcoding region, leaving us only approximately 800 base pairs to be sequenced. (A more detailed look at other fungal barcoding regions is available <a class="ulink" href="http://bit.ly/PUjeqn" target="_top">online</a>.</p>
<p id="but_ive_skippe">But I’ve skipped over a part, and it’s a part that needed a lot of debugging. How do you extract the DNA from the fungal cells? Many of you have probably seen the demonstration of getting DNA from a strawberry—if not, it’s a great instructional activity and a lot of fun. There’s a complete protocol <a class="ulink" href="http://1.usa.gov/1gWxogq" target="_top">online</a>. Unfortunately, most fungi are not as easy as strawberries. Trying to extract DNA with the dishwashing detergent, salt, and water mix that works well on strawberries isn’t effective on most fungi. This step of the DNA prep consists of breaking the cell open—through mechanical and chemical means with a lysis buffer—then precipitating the proteins and spinning down the precipitate in a centrifuge (this leaves the DNA in the <span class="keep-together">supernatant</span>—the liquid on top of the pellet of protein). Then, with the proteins gone, you perform an isopropanol extraction of the DNA and an ethanol wash. Finally, the DNA is rehydrated and ready to be used. I started out trying to use the cell lysis buffer from a Carolina Biological barcoding kit, but that seemed to be a protocol geared mostly toward plants, and none of the first three mushrooms I tried in that protocol produced any template DNA. Frustrated, I ordered a DNA prep kit from Feldan (kit number 9K-006-0016) and tried that. It still didn’t work very well. Finally, using the cell grinding and mechanical disruption from the Carolina kit and the lysis buffer from the Feldan kit, I began to get results—at least, from some of the mushrooms. There remain some mushrooms that I am not very successful in getting DNA out of: specifically, the ascomycetes, which include mushrooms such as morels, seem to be very resistant to DNA extraction using this protocol. In the end, I suspect I will have to use more forceful mechanical disruption techniques, perhaps sonication or something else that would release more DNA. I would also like to find a cheaper DNA prep solution—perhaps guanidine for a lysis buffer instead of depending on kits that end up costing 75 cents or so per prep.</p>
<p id="if_all_has_gone">If all has gone well in the DNA extraction, you see an 800-base pair band when you run a gel of the PCR product. (Running a gel consists of pulling negatively charged DNA through a gel matrix using electrical potential in order to sort the DNA fragments by size.) Before sending things away for sequencing, it’s important to verify that you have produced a nice sharp band on the gel, indicating that the barcoding region was properly amplified. Here was the place where a second round of debugging was needed. Gel electrophoresis is a basic procedure that is used in all sorts of molecular biology, including protein and DNA identification. When using gel electrophoresis for identifying DNA fragments, you generally run a lane of the gel with a size standard. This is known as a DNA ladder, and allows you to compare your unknown DNA fragments with DNA fragments of known size. When I ran the first gel I didn’t see anything, not even the ladder DNA. This told me that something was wrong with my gel.</p>
<p id="historically_g">Historically, gels have been run using a DNA binding dye called ethidium bromide (EtBr.) It’s very effective, but EtBr is a mutagen and requires hazardous waste disposal, so most labs try to move away from using it. One of the gel dyes that I like is called <a class="ulink" href="http://bit.ly/1iHavSu" target="_top">GelGreen</a>, but it had been a few months since I last used my stock of GelGreen. Apparently it is not as shelf-stable as would be ideal. When I saw nothing, I ran a gel on EtBr and at least saw my ladder bands, so I knew something was there. One of the other folks in the lab, Vince, had the bright idea to use a UV laser (405 nm) to excite the GelGreen rather than the set of blue LEDs that we normally use. When viewed through an orange filter, the laser illumination let the dim bands pop out, whereas they were not visible at all under our normal illumination. We ordered new GelGreen and will go back to our normal gel procedures soon, but maybe we’ll get Vince to write up an article on his super-sensitive laser gelbox in a future <span class="emphasis"><em>BioCoder</em></span> issue. Seeing the ladder bands gave me confidence in the lack of amplification of the samples and led me back to debugging either the PCR process or the DNA extraction process, and concluding in this case that it was an extraction problem.</p>
<p id="at_this_point_i">At this point I have a couple species of mushroom sent off for sequencing, but no results yet (see <a class="xref" href="ch08.html#gel-samples-fungi" title="Figure 8-1. Gel electrophoresis of the two samples, Pseudohydnum gelatinosum and Sparassis crispa, in lanes 13 and 14. S. crispa is showing a double band and had to be rejected for sequencing, but P. gelatinosum was properly identified by sequence results.">Figure 8-1</a>). The experts identified them as <span class="emphasis"><em>Sparassis crispa</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>Pseudohydnum gelatinosum</em></span>, but we’ll see if that’s what they really are. Then there are about 40 more samples to run through that we collected from the mushroom shows. We’ll go through the bioinformatics in the next issue, after I get results back. My current passion happens to be fungi, but DNA barcoding is applicable to any living organism you might be interested in. I bet there are new discoveries to be made right in your backyard!</p>

<div><h1 class="title">Chapter 9. Interview with Ian Marcus of SynBio4All</h1></div>
<div><h3 class="subtitle"><em>An Open, Online Platform for Collaboration on Synthetic Biology Projects</em></h3></div>
<div><div class="author"><h3 class="author"><span class="othername">Noah Most</span></h3></div></div>
</div></div>
<p id="we_all_have_id">"We all have ideas," Ian Marcus, the project leader of <a class="ulink" href="http://synbio4all.org/" target="_top">SynBio4All</a>, told me as we sat down at the <a class="ulink" href="http://cybersciencesummit.org/" target="_top">Citizen Cyberscience Conference 2014</a>, "but why is it that the only people that can come up with ideas are people that have been very myopic in their research?"</p>
<p id="while_many_citi">While many citizen science programs channel that spirit, top-down initiatives dominate the largely academic-led citizen science landscape. Typically, laypeople are limited to either collecting data (<a class="ulink" href="http://ebird.org/content/ebird/" target="_top">eBird</a>) or recognizing patterns (<a class="ulink" href="http://whale.fm/" target="_top">WhaleFM</a>). Many initiatives define citizen <span class="keep-together">science</span> as merely a way for citizens to help scientists. Although these top-down initiatives have yielded many exciting results, including more than <a class="ulink" href="https://www.zooniverse.org/publications" target="_top">50 publications</a> out of the <a class="ulink" href="https://www.zooniverse.org/" target="_top">Zooniverse citizen science portal</a>, there has been comparatively little support by academics to affirm citizens' capabilities <span class="emphasis"><em>as</em></span> scientists—able to develop interesting ideas, design valid protocols, and interpret results.</p>
<p id="synbioall_dev">SynBio4All, developed at the Paris Descartes University, aims to help change that. "SynBio4All is an open, online, collaborative platform by which citizen scientists, DIYbiologists, and academics could take a project from start to finish," Marcus explained. "They come up with the idea, they design the project, they help with the lab work if they want, and they disseminate the results to the public. And all of it is open, online, and for everybody to see."</p>
<p id="part_massively_">Part massively open online course (MOOC) for synthetic biology, part open laboratory notebook, and part discussion platform, SynBio4All aspires to be a hub for people to learn about synthetic biology and collaborate on open science projects. Anyone, Marcus said, can float an idea on the platform and the community can help build a research plan, aid in the interpretation of results, and even "take [the idea] in a totally different direction."</p>
<p id="marcus_wishes_t">Marcus wishes that such a platform had existed while he worked on his PhD. "I didn’t know who to talk to and there was no real communication with anyone. It would have been nice to have just this type of platform on which I could say, ‘Has anyone thought about this technique before?’ I found that in the academic lab, things were very closed. We didn’t want to get scooped. You didn’t want to totally say exactly what research you were doing."</p>
<p id="the_plan_is_for">The plan is for the research process to be broken down so that beginners are not immediately turned off from the experience. "We don’t want to overwhelm everyone up front, so everything is done in a very digestible manner."</p>
<p id="if_successful_">If successful, Marcus hopes that a learning-through-research model will demonstrate a "new style of pedagogy," so that ultimately children, "born scientists," do not have their natural inclinations to experiment "[taken] away from them in this almost factory setting of schools."</p>
<p id="with_more_indiv">With more individuals—both newcomers and veterans—participating in an open process, Marcus wants to improve science itself. "There’s a lot of stuff that we can all share, there are a lot of techniques that a lot of people know that others don’t know, and there are a lot of ideas out there. Bringing it all together in one place could perhaps maximize our efficiency."</p>
<p id="however_not_ev">However, not every part of the platform is complete: the design plan and project pages are under construction. Perhaps the biggest question is how many citizens will show up. The SynBio4All team would love to see iGEM teams, would-be iGEM teams without funding, and DIYbiologists use their platform.</p>
<p id="while_marcus_no">While Marcus noted that some counter-cultural elements of DIYbio seek to demonstrate that "we don’t need academics," he hopes that by providing a useful communication tool he can "bring the counter and culture together."</p>
<p id="if_that_fails_">If that fails, perhaps the allure of top-notch equipment, project funding, and a lab bench might help. SynBio4All offers a unique pathway for nonprofessionals to land a bench and funding at <a class="ulink" href="http://synbio4all.org/about-our-lab/" target="_top">a synthetic biology lab</a> at Paris Descartes University.</p>
<p id="were_going_to">"We’re going to end up having two projects come to our lab" from the platform between June and August, Marcus explained. This lab can support projects both this year and the next. If all goes well, the program will be continued. Moreover, by allowing citizens to showcase their projects on the platform, Marcus hopes to make others in academia more willing to collaborate with citizens in the future.</p>

Introduction to Carbon Metabolism (April 17, 2014)
</span></dt>
<dd>
This course is an introduction to fundamental keys and concepts of central metabolism as relevant to synthetic biology and metabolic engineering. We begin by discussing metabolites as requirements for life to exist and give a birds-eye view of the major pathways cells use to fulfill those requirements. We discuss general thermodynamic principles in biological systems, microbial fermentation, and microbial respiration. We will analyze metabolic pathways on the basis of carbon use, ATP use, and redox balance. After learning these skills, we will identify advantages and disadvantages of possible synthetic <span class="keep-together">biology</span> routes to common household products and chemicals of the biotech <span class="keep-together">industry</span>.
</dd>
<dt><span class="term">
Big Data for Synthetic Biology: An Introduction to Bioinformatics (April 24, 2014)
</span></dt>
<dd>
You will learn the basics of bioinformatics, a multidisciplinary field with specializations that include interpreting human genetics, developing new medicines, and uncovering the underlying mechanisms of cellular function. We will start with a general introduction to the field as a whole, and then dive in with a number of hands-on examples where you will assemble a miniature “reference” genome, evaluate a disease-causing genetic mutation, and assess the success of sample drug trial results. Through these examples, we will uncover the principles behind genome sequencing, interpretation of expression data (RNA-seq and arrays), and personalized medicine. Finally, we will cover introductory statistics (which will be required for interpreting data) and the potential ethical implications of applied bioengineering.

Never clone alone…join the class and build a color-generating microbe using the Genomikon system. Synthetic biology is the science of engineering living organisms as if they were biological machines. You’ll learn how to manipulate life using standardized genetic parts. These genetic sequences serve as building blocks in the fabrication of genetic “circuits,” previously unseen in nature. Among many applications, this rapidly maturing technology is currently being harnessed to cheaply create life-saving drugs, biofuels to reduce dependence on petroleum-based fuel sources, and biosensors to detect a wide variety of environmental pollutants and pathogens . As part of this very hands-on course, we’ll build a set of DNA "parts" into a plasmid using the Genomikon kit and load it into bacteria. We will also analyze pathways that enable engineered <span class="keep-together">microorganisms</span> to smell like bananas and respond to different genetic "instructions."

<p id="thanks_to_those">Thanks to those of you who are returning to BioCoder, and welcome to the new readers and contributors. The first issue of BioCoder reached more than 10,000 readers, and we hope that number continues to grow. We’ve put together an exciting second issue and think you’ll find the diverse content to be educational and <span class="keep-together">inspirational.</span></p>
<p id="i_taught_labora">I taught laboratory courses for a couple years after earning my PhD, but I then decided to dive back into research. However, I still wanted to teach, but I wanted to teach individuals who chose the topics they wanted to learn and who attended the classes for their own personal development. That led to the creation of IdeaLab at BioCurious in Sunnyvale, California: a meeting to discuss current research topics, analyze scientific articles, and generate project ideas. After a successful year of the class, we joined forces with Genspace and created a virtual journal club open to all individuals with the desire to learn about current topics in research.  Within the independent scientist community, this is one example of many ways in which individuals are learning research fundamentals, broadening their areas of knowledge and expertise, and sparking new project ideas and collaborative efforts.</p>
<p id="what_does_this_">What does this have to do with BioCoder?</p>
<p id="biocoder_is_ano">BioCoder is another forum to educate those who are willing to learn, but with this venue, we have the opportunity to reach a larger audience. This means that we can inspire those who aren’t involved in biology to get involved, make science less intimidating and more accessible, enhance collaboration, and maybe even affect science policy.  I challenge you to think about ways in which you can continue to spread the knowledge that will affect public opinion. We are doing amazing things in biology, bioengineering, and related areas of research, and you’ll see many examples of that in this issue. The content ranges from scientific education through museum exhibitions and bioart to an exploration of entrepreneurial topics for the independent scientists, including tips on crowdfunding your project, biosafety rules and regulations, biological gaming, and open source healthcare.</p>
<p id="we_will_continu">We will continue to include diverse content in BioCoder issues, but in order to fulfill that promise, we need to hear from you, our readers. If you have a unique perspective on scientific happenings outside of traditional settings—or maybe <span class="keep-together">untraditional</span> scientific happenings in traditional settings—please contact us at <code class="email">&lt;<a class="email" href="mailto:biocoder@oreilly.com">biocoder@oreilly.com</a>&gt;</code>.

<div><h1 class="title">Chapter 2. DIYbio and the Hacking Metaphor</h1></div>
<div><div class="author"><h3 class="author"><span class="othername">Michael Scroggins</span></h3></div></div>
</div></div>
<p id="within_diybio_">Within DIYbio, one cannot escape the hacking metaphor. The metaphor is ubiquitous and, to a point, useful. The term connotes both productive play with an existing technology aimed at improvement and, at the same time, play with sinister undertones. In this sense, hacking captures the promise and pitfalls of the dual uses any mature technology might be put to, whether that technology is as dramatic as nuclear power/weapons or as mundane as a free/premium software license. But every metaphor has its limits. Pushed too far, metaphors break down, and instead of illuminating, they obscure. Which brings me to ask: how far can the hacking metaphor be pushed within DIYbio—at least the part of DIYbio falling in line with synthetic biology?</p>
<p id="nowhere_has_the">Nowhere has the hacking metaphor been taken as literally as Andrew Hessel, Marc Goodman, and Steven Kotler took it in the 2012 <span class="emphasis"><em>Atlantic</em></span> article, “Hacking the President’s DNA.” Hessel, Goodman, and Kotler imagine a world in which biology is a mature technology and maps one-to-one with computer programming. A world where novices can create human viruses and infect individuals with them in just the same way the unskilled can infect computers with malware. They craft a dramatic narrative around this metaphor by imagining the president of the United States as the target of sinister biohackers. The authors justify the premise of their article by arguing that the technology to make the scenario plausible is accelerating at an exponential rate and that it will only be a few short years before it is mature and ubiquitous. Therefore, better to prepare now than suffer tomorrow.</p>
<p id="but_is_this_the">But is this the case? Is biology a few years away from the scenario outlined in <span class="emphasis"><em>The Atlantic</em></span>? Two years ago, I attended a symposium on the current state and future of synthetic biology. It was the usual mix of technical talks and hallway <span class="keep-together">conversations,</span> but a question asked in the plenary roundtable stood out. During the Q&amp;A, a young undergraduate asked a synthetic biologist the following question:</p>
<div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote">
<p id="undergrad_at_g"><span class="emphasis"><em>Undergrad</em></span>: At Google, an entry-level job requires a BA, but in synthetic biology, an entry-level job requires a postdoc. Should this be rethought?</p>
<p id="biologist_have"><span class="emphasis"><em>Biologist</em></span>: Have you looked into DIYbio?</p>
</blockquote></div>
<p id="the_undergrad_b">The undergrad brushed off the biologist’s response as beside the point, and the testy exchange ended shortly thereafter with the biologist pointing out that there was much basic research to be done in creating tools for the commons. But the undergrad’s question remains hanging. What kind of training counts here? There is an established discourse holding that synthetic biology—and, by extension, much of DIYbio—is analogous to computer science, but the implication of the student’s question and the biologist’s deflection argue for a different answer. The question posed to the biologist has two parts, both of which shed light on the scenario envisioned by Hessel, Goodman, and Kotler: a) why must so much synthetic biology be done <span class="emphasis"><em>in vivo</em></span> or <span class="emphasis"><em>in vitro</em></span>, not <span class="emphasis"><em>in silico</em></span>, thus making necessary a long and arduous course of laboratory training? and b) why doesn’t the work translate directly to the <span class="emphasis"><em>in-vivo</em></span> world outside the laboratory and thus bring about an industry comparable to the software industry?</p>
<p id="in_answering_an">In answering an earlier question posed during the roundtable, the biologist picked up on the tool comment when he said there was basic work in metrology to be done in synthetic biology before the academic work could be  readily translated into the commercial realm. This has been true in almost all theoretical fields that have been translated into commercial ventures. The fact that synthetic biology is still coming to terms with metrology means that it has many years of difficult laboratory work ahead and that the scenario envisioned by Hessel, Goodman, and Kotler is more fear mongering than an accurate assessment of the near-future <span class="keep-together">possibilities.</span></p>

</div></div>
<p id="growing_up_in_n">Growing up in New York City, I have vivid memories of taking class trips during grade school to the American Museum of Natural History. Located right across the street from Manhattan’s equally historic Central Park, I remember the breathtakingly realistic dioramas of stuffed and mounted wildlife, representative of every continent. Posed within meticulously crafted environments that captured their habitat and behavior in a three-dimensional snapshot, they were encased behind walls of glass. Despite their continued haunting beauty, they also unwittingly captured forever a past outlook on science’s interaction with the public. The exhibits said almost as much about the societal mindset that had created them as they did about the flora and fauna held within. With the work of science hermetically sealed off, only to be gazed at with passive awe, they placed the uninitiated public squarely to one side of the scientific divide.</p>
<p id="on_few_occasion">On few occasions, as young students, we sometimes managed to get a glimpse of the scientific work that went on behind the scenes. Once, we even got to go on a special trip to the geology laboratories that were closed off to the general public where the staff scientists analyzed specimens for the museum. At that time, during the early 1980s, that was as close to interactivity as it got for me at a science museum. However, things have been rapidly changing, and it seems that the spirit of the late '60s has finally penetrated science museums around the globe.</p>
<div class="sect1" data-original-filename="Second-Issue-From-Closed-Exhibits-to-Open-Labs.asciidoc" id="_interactivity_at_the_exploratorium">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title">Interactivity at the Exploratorium</h2></div></div></div>
<p id="but_just_what_i">But just what is the mission of a museum these days, especially one dedicated to the dissemination of science? According to the Merriam-Webster online dictionary, one definition is “a building in which interesting and valuable things (such as paintings and sculptures or scientific or historical objects) are collected and shown to the public.” Simple and to the point as far as storing and displaying artifacts is
concerned, but what about when it comes to science and technology museums?</p>
<p id="with_the_advent">With the advent of the Exploratorium in San Francisco in the summer of 1969, the science museum was effectively reinvented. Started by the physicist Dr. Frank Oppenheimer, the Exploratorium was to be an entirely new way of educating the public. A space where interactivity was the rule, with static hands-off displays being replaced by hands-on exhibits that encouraged the public to tinker, engaging the
additional senses of touch and sound.</p>
<p id="this_radical_de">This radical departure from the traditional, staid museum caught on rapidly, with science, technology, and even math museums around the nation vying to outdo one another in the depths of interactivity. In
this era of high-bandwidth connectivity, 3D printers, and cheap, fast electronics, the tools at the disposal of the science museum curator offer unprecedented flexibility to design immersive scientific exhibits.</p>
<p id="exhibits_are_on">Exhibits are one thing, but museums—ever on the lookout for the next wave in the promotion of science—are now opening up their spaces to the teaching of science, technology, and medicine. As one example, the Liberty Science Center, opened in 1993 in New Jersey, has multiple laboratories where students can do projects and take courses. There are even teleconferencing links for students to talk to surgeons live during open-heart surgery!</p>
<p id="the_american_mu">The American Museum of Natural History also offers a diverse variety of hands-on, after-school research programs available for students, in subjects as diverse as biotechnology and astronomy. Other museums, such as the New York Hall of Science, along with the Exploratorium on the West Coast, play host to the annual Maker Faire, the wildly popular gathering of makers, doers, tinkerers, and inventors.</p>
<p id="with_all_this_h">With all this happening at science museums, is there anything else left for them to do? Have we possibly reached the limits of public involvement in science and technology?</p>

<p id="the_emphasis_on">The emphasis on citizen science-based initiatives has definitely not escaped notice in science museums around the world. This past month, I was privileged to visit and help organize and run several biotechnology workshops held at the Zhejiang Science and Technology Museum (ZJMST) just south of Shanghai, in the city of Hangzhou in China (see <a class="xref" href="ch03.html#oliver201" title="Figure 3-1. Staff of Zhejiang Science and Technology Museum practice pipetting for a multiplex PCR and gel electrophoresis workshop used to identify several species of animals for the purposes of food identification">Figure 3-1</a> and <a class="xref" href="ch03.html#oliver202" title="Figure 3-2. Staff of Zhejiang Science and Technology Museum use electrodes placed on the surface of their skin and connected to a SpikerBox, an inexpensive open source device used to amplify and measure the rates of action potentials traveling through neurons">Figure 3-2</a>). Part of its stated mission is to lead the development of science museums in Zhejiang Province and to disseminate scientific knowledge to the public. Along with my friend, neuroscientist Dr. Pia-Kelsey O’Neill from Columbia University, I embarked on the trip at the request of Bing Zhu, the deputy director of the International Department of ZAST, the Zhejiang Association for Science and Technology. ZAST is tasked with helping to promote scientific outreach within the province of Zhejiang. Each province in China has its own Association for Science and Technology, with similar missions. Upon arrival, we were quickly introduced to Mr. Li Ruihong, the director of the science museum. Ever since the initiative to promote interactive exhibits was launched at the Exploratorium, the continued evolution of science museums and the expanding roles that they can play as advocates of science has certainly taken root around the world. After many discussions with staff at ZJMST, it quickly became apparent that they were ready to start moving beyond what had been
achieved thus far. Our brainstorming discussions started to envision how open labs could function in spaces such as science museums.</p>

<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title">A New Community of Science</h2></div></div></div>
<p id="where_do_i_see_">Where do I see the evolution of science museums heading? With the flexibility inherent in their mission as public institutions dedicated to the promotion of science and technology to all citizens, I believe that they are uniquely poised to play a central role in helping to launch citizen-science initiatives. They can act as hubs for the planning, gathering, and analysis of data gathered from a variety of crowd-sourced projects. They can serve as a fertile meeting ground between educated amateurs and trained scientists. And not least, like community biotechnology laboratories and hackerspaces, with no inherent publish-or-perish imperative, science can be more freely pursued here in the most positive sense of the term "amateur": for the sheer love of gathering knowledge.</p>
<p id="those_who_have_">Those who have participated in shared coworking spaces, either community biotech labs or other hacker spaces, have experienced firsthand the need for more spaces that facilitate such interactions. With the addition of community laboratories, a huge step will be taken, not just toward the global accessibility of scientific information, but for the practice of science as well. Will the establishment of open community laboratories within science museums harbor the emergence of a sort of new secular cathedral? Will there be a global race among museums and nations to outdo one another in making the skills, tools, and philosophy of science and technology accessible to everyone as a result? If yes, then this is a trend I will certainly be supporting.</p>

<div><h1 class="title">Chapter 4. On Art and Science: The Enlightened Renaissance</h1></div>
<div><div class="author"><h3 class="author"><span class="othername">Simona Zompi</span></h3></div></div>
</div></div>
<p id="the_studies_of_">The studies of art and science were not mutually exclusive until the late 19th century, when specialization became fashionable and separated the two. Science education became even more fashionable in the education system, as it was easier to measure as compared to arts and humanities—it’s easy to evaluate if a student has learned math, but harder to evaluate whether she is a good writer or a promising painter.</p>
<p id="it_was_not_unti">It was not until the late 20th century, with the boom of design into technology, that the arts regained a space in the innovation field. The explosion of hacker spaces and DIYbio laboratories became fertile ground to intersect art and science, and they’re both the consequence and the cradles of what I like to call the “Enlightened Renaissance."</p>
<p id="when_we_think_a">When we think about iconic figures mixing art and science, the first person who comes to mind is Leonardo da Vinci (1452–1519), the archetypal Renaissance man. An artist by training, his curiosity in scientific observation and his accurate records in journals made him a scientist. He made exceptional contributions to the study of human anatomy, being one of the first to draw the internal organs and the development of fetuses in the womb. But more importantly, he linked the observation of the human heart with its physiology, describing how heart valves control the flow of blood, bringing together art and physiology. This was not science based on experimentation or testing of theories, but rather it was a different approach to science: intense observation and detailed recording.</p>
<p id="leonardo_initia">Leonardo initially turned to science in order to improve his artwork; he studied the science of light and the proportions of the human body exemplified in the Vitruvian Man. But who are those scientists who turn to art in order to improve their scientific work?</p>
<p id="intense_observa">Intense observation as developed by visual arts can greatly improve scientists’ observational skills. Dr. Karen Sokal-Gutierrez, a physician and researcher at UC Berkeley, told me that after she started painting human bodies and skin tones—mixing different pigments (Prussian blue, burnt sienna, cadmium red and yellow, and different greens)—she started examining her patients differently. Exercising her eyes through painting helped her medical practice by developing the range of colors and tones she could see.</p>
<p id="charles_darwin_">Charles Darwin (1809–1882), the most famous natural scientist of his century, drew inspiration from the tradition of natural history and illustration, namely geological and botanical drawings. This closeness to nature is still inspiring today’s environmental scientists. In turn, Darwin’s theory inspired many artists, especially the French impressionist painters, such as Cezanne and Monet, and influenced the meaning of beauty. Sir Alexander Fleming (1881–1995), the discoverer of the popular antibiotic penicillin, was a scientist and also a painter and a member of the Chelsea Arts Club, a private club for artists. He mostly used watercolors, but he also used live organisms and was the first to experiment with microbial art in his “germ paintings”—Fleming would inoculate petri dishes with different bacterial species to create live paintings that would <a class="ulink" href="http://www.microbialart.com/galleries/fleming/" target="_top">fade away once the bacteria died</a>. In order to develop his microbial art, Fleming had to find microbes with different pigments and then time his inoculations such that the different species all matured at the same time. The inspiration for this art would drive the discovery of new microbes.</p>
<p id="as_he_developed">As he developed intense observation through his art practice, Fleming’s discovery of penicillin may not be as fortuitous as some may think. His discovery came about when he accidentally left on his bench several petri dishes plated with the bacteria staphylococcus. After a few weeks, returning from vacation, he noticed that a fungus, penicillium, had contaminated one of the petri dishes and that the bacteria directly surrounding the fungus were dead.  Many before him probably had petri dishes contaminated by mold, but his observation skills made him see through the petri dishes and deduce that the mold had killed the bacterial colonies. Among all his germ paintings, he had made a masterpiece that would save millions of lives.</p>
<p id="after_fleming_">After Fleming, many experimented with living bacteria and art. <span class="emphasis"><em>Exploring the Invisible</em></span> is a collaboration between the artist Ann Brodie and the microbiologist Dr. Simon Park. They used a strain of bioluminescent bacteria, Photobacterium <span class="keep-together">Phosphoreum,</span> as the source of light in a dark chamber called the bioluminescent photo booth. Volunteers were photographed or recorded in the booth exploring <a class="ulink" href="http://bioproject.tumblr.com/" target="_top">new interactions between microbes and humans</a>. The Bioglyphs Project at Montana State Unversity uses <a class="ulink" href="http://www.biofilm.montana.edu/Bioglyphs/" target="_top">bioluminescent bacteria to create all forms of art</a>. Dr. Peta Clancy’s <span class="emphasis"><em>Visible Human Bodies</em></span> uses inoculated petri dishes <a class="ulink" href="http://petaclancy.com/works/" target="_top">to “paint” human bodies</a> just like Sir Fleming did before her.</p>
<p id="john_maeda_pre">John Maeda, president of the Rhode Island School of Design, said that “innovation doesn’t just come from equations or new kinds of chemicals, it comes from a human place. Innovation in the sciences is always linked in some way, either directly or indirectly, to a human experience. And human experiences happen through engaging with the arts—listening to music, say, or seeing a piece of art.” Scientists are humans after all. He insists on the need to add an “A for art” to the mix of STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) programs, creating STEAM.</p>
<p id="some_schools_in">Some schools in California have integrated STEM and arts. At UC Davis, the <a class="ulink" href="http://artsciencefusion.ucdavis.edu/homepage.html" target="_top">Art and Science Fusion Program</a> follows Darwin’s path, combining natural history, environment, and art. At Stanford, <a class="ulink" href="http://www.stanford.edu/~suemcc/TSR/" target="_top">the Senior Reflection (TSR) program</a>, led by Andrew Todhunter and Dr. Susan McConnell, allows senior undergraduates majoring in science to create an art piece based on their favorite science topic. This art piece is meant to be the capstone creation of the students' four years of college. The Center for Science Education at UC Berkeley Space Sciences Laboratory, directed by Dr. Laura Peticolas, integrates art and science by <a class="ulink" href="http://cse.ssl.berkeley.edu/arts/news.html" target="_top">bringing artists in residence into the lab</a>.  Most recently, three students at UC Berkeley—Natalie Mal, Kimiya Hojjat, and Angela Weinberg—inspired by Stanford TSR, started leading a DeCal course on art and science to explore how the two fields interact and cross-fertilize. The launch of the DeCal earlier this year was a huge success. Many students had to be turned down, and only 16 students were allowed to join the class to keep the group small and interactive. This past December, an art show showcased students’ original work. Finally, the Leonardo Art and Science Evening Rendezvous (LASERs) started by Piero Scaruffi in 2008 has now piqued national interest, bringing artists and scientists together <a class="ulink" href="http://www.scaruffi.com/leonardo/" target="_top">to foster interdisciplinary work</a>. These meetings are open to the general public and take place in colleges and universities, bringing the public closer to academia.</p>
<p id="the_renaissance">The Renaissance was a time of wondrous discoveries, when any enquiring mind would be encouraged to pursue scientific discoveries. The Age of Enlightenment, beginning in the late 17th and 18th centuries, advanced knowledge using scientific experimental methods. During this time, scientific publications, salons, and debating societies bloomed all over Europe. Art allows more intuition and a larger perspective; it allows reaching the limits of what is possible, breaking of scientific rules, and creation of new and unique ideas. The hacker’s revolution is a return to the Renaissance age mixed with the Age of Enlightenment. It allows anyone to use scientific experimental models mixed with a broader artistic intuition. With hackers’ spaces and DIYbio spaces we are entering the age of the “Enlightened Renaissance."</p>

</div></div>
<p id="until_august_">Until August 2014, I will be traveling the globe visiting people within the DIYbio community and playing around with biology. In October, I finished up what was a grand introduction to DIYbio in Victoria, Canada, at the Victoria Makerspace. Among many amazing experiences, I worked on a project to explore the feasibility of DNA origami for DIYbio.</p>
<div class="sect1" data-original-filename="Second-Issue_-DIYbio-Around-the-World,-Part-II.asciidoc" id="_diy_dna_origami_wrapping_up_from_last_issue_footnote_simpara_most_noah_diybio_around_the_world_emphasis_biocoder_emphasis_fall_2013_simpara_footnote">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title">DIY DNA Origami: Wrapping Up from Last Issue<a href="#ftn.id466650" class="footnote"><sup class="footnote" id="id466650">[1]</sup></a>
</h2></div></div></div>
<p id="paul_rothemund_">Paul Rothemund dropped a gauntlet in his <a class="ulink" href="http://www.ted.com/talks/paul_rothemund_details_dna_folding.html" target="_top">2008 TED talk</a>, describing his new method in the field of DNA nanotechnology as "so easy you could do it at home in your kitchen and design the stuff on a laptop." That method is called DNA origami, and it enables you to treat DNA as a nanoscale construction material. For example, researchers have used this technique to create nanorobots for the delivery of drugs<a href="#ftn.id466669" class="footnote"><sup class="footnote" id="id466669">[2]</sup></a> as well as programmable nano-breadboards.<a href="#ftn.id466678" class="footnote"><sup class="footnote" id="id466678">[3]</sup></a> A long, single-stranded DNA "scaffold," typically the M13mp18 bacteriophage, is folded upon itself and pinched into the desired shape by oligonucleotide "staples" that are easily designed on the computer.<a href="#ftn.id466689" class="footnote"><sup class="footnote" id="id466689">[4]</sup></a> To our knowledge, no one has taken Rothemund up on the kitchen biology challenge and actually attempted DIY DNA origami. Last issue, I examined whether this could be a reasonable DIYbio project, and in this issue, I can happily report an answer: yes! We successfully synthesized a proof-of-concept design, a simple 2D light bulb, and imaged it with an atomic force microscope (AFM). In tandem, we produced a crash course in DNA origami that made it so conceptually accessible that even a 12-year-old understood it.</p>
<p id="however_that_">However, that "yes" should be qualified by a discussion of some of the difficulties we encountered while imaging our nanostructure. Although the design and synthesis of DNA origami structures is relatively straightforward, imaging takes some patience and adds further cost. Microscope time will typically cost you per hour. AFM probes cost around $30 each and typically come in packs of no fewer than 10, which is more than should be needed for a single design. (For a review of other major costs, see my article in the fall 2013 issue of BioCoder.<a href="#ftn.id466711" class="footnote"><sup class="footnote" id="id466711">[5]</sup></a>) The tip of a new probe can be destroyed in an instant if it is mishandled or dropped. More perplexingly, it took several sittings for us to produce decent AFM images without procedural changes clearly accounting for the difference in image quality. However, some of these problems may stem from using AFM probes with fewer floppy tips than is typical for the method. Finally, documentation of imaging protocol in the literature is often too brief to be useful to a newcomer. As a result, we somewhat blindly tried to figure out everything on our own, before finally, in a magical moment, we saw our tiny light bulb, less than 1,000th the width of a human hair.</p>
<p id="these_obstacles">These obstacles should not be prohibitive, and most can be avoided. To avoid them, we recommend that you contact us or convince a nearby professional DNA origami lab to let you observe its imaging protocol. While DNA origami remains more expensive than the typical DIY activity, the field oozes excitement because it is almost the Wild West—fresh, unexplored territory. Only a fraction of its potential applications have even been imagined, so give it a try!</p>

<div class="sect1" data-original-filename="Second-Issue_-DIYbio-Around-the-World,-Part-II.asciidoc" id="_science_gallery_dublin_ireland">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title">Science Gallery, Dublin, Ireland</h2></div></div></div>
<p id="after_victoria">After Victoria, my original intention to visit the Manchester MadLab abruptly veered off course when presented with an awesome detour to help Dr. Ellen Jorgensen, of Genspace in New York, with an exhibition at the <a class="ulink" href="https://dublin.sciencegallery.com/" target="_top">Science Gallery</a> in Dublin, Ireland. The Science Gallery houses four to six rotating art and science themes per year, and, from October 2013 until January 2014, it’s hosting <span class="emphasis"><em>Grow Your Own</em></span>, an exhibition that examines biotechnology like synthetic biology and its implications. Since no discussion of the implications of synthetic biology is complete without mention of DIYbio, Ellen set up a small community lab in the gallery so that gallery-goers could see, and do, synthetic biology themselves.</p>
<p id="i_hadnt_met_el">I hadn’t met Ellen in person before, so she welcomed me by interrogation. Hurling rapid-fire questions in my direction, she tested my ability to address the most persnickety and combative journalism. After I weathered her barrage (it was actually fun), Ellen warmed up, I donned a ridiculous tie-dye lab coat, and we set about entertaining and educating visitors about our glass box. Gallery-goers toured the community lab, asked questions about DIYbio and synthetic biology, had their DNA extracted, examined one of their genes by PCR, tried out some wet work (a Genomikon kit) themselves, and/or saw what were, to some, downright terrifying genetically engineered organisms.</p>
<p id="one_advantage_o">One advantage of DIYbio is that it’s hands on, which amplifies its power as a communication tool. Genetic engineering is much less intrinsically terrifying when you see it firsthand. An older woman walked into our lab and said, "You don’t do any of that genetic engineering stuff, do you?" I grabbed a nearby plate with E. coli that had been engineered to express green fluorescent protein (GFP) from a jellyfish, and said, stretching it out, "Yes, in fact, we do." Literally jumping backward, she shrieked, "That’s dangerous!" Half an hour later, she had gotten much more comfortable with the nonpathogenic, highly attenuated strain on the plate, and maybe even the idea that genetic engineering products are not <span class="emphasis"><em>necessarily</em></span> harmful, irrespective of what was changed. Having Nobel Prize–winning examples, like GFP, in hand certainly helps dispel disproportionate fears.</p>
<p id="what_are_artist">What are artists saying about the brave new biotech world? The other pieces in the Science Gallery likely raise more fears than they dispel, but in doing so also highlight important questions. For example, <a class="ulink" href="https://dublin.sciencegallery.com/growyourown/strangervisions" target="_top">Heather Dewey-Hagborg</a>, who collaborated with Genspace, found items discarded by strangers on the streets and created a portrait of them based on just their DNA, which told her about ancestry, freckles, eye color, etc. The result is remarkably creepy. Anonymous faces stare blankly out from a wall—the source of all the information, a simple cigarette butt, below. However, the implications of the work are even creepier. What does it say about privacy when someone can sense your key physical attributes and whether you have an increased risk of Parkinson’s from almost anything you leave behind?</p>
<p id="the_new_weather"><a class="ulink" href="https://dublin.sciencegallery.com/growyourown/newweathermen" target="_top"><span class="emphasis"><em>The New Weathermen</em></span></a> by David Beneque imagines that a renegade activist group uses biotechnology to advance its environmental aims. They target the African oil palm, which produces the cheap palm oil often found in fast food. Many groups, such as <a class="ulink" href="http://bit.ly/1aJMC9u" target="_top">Greenpeace</a>, criticize the expansion of the tree’s cultivation because it may be done at the expense of rainforests. The installation diagrams their attack plan. They infect the world’s palm oil trees, genetically engineering their oil so that it gives people indigestion. Palm oil trees are now worthless, the rainforests are saved, and the renegades reap an additional reward: "#Biolulz."</p>
<p id="perhaps_the_pie">Perhaps the piece I enjoyed the most was one that appeared on my plate. The <a class="ulink" href="http://genomicgastronomy.com/" target="_top">Center for Genomic Gastronomy</a> hosted a meal where each of the six courses was designed to make you look not only at your plate, but also at the issues surrounding it, in a new way. For example, I devoured a dish made of invasive organisms, a pigeon standing in for a de-extincted carrier pigeon, and, my personal favorite, ribs with Cobalt 60 BBQ sauce, which largely uses ingredients generated with radiation mutagenesis. This virtually unknown process to rapidly generate mutants with useful traits underpins many of the crops  we eat today—some 3,000 have been released—and stands in sharp contrast to genetically engineered foods, which have attracted much greater <a class="ulink" href="http://bit.ly/1cWfvff" target="_top">public scrutiny</a>. I adored this dinner because it amplified attendees' interest in biotechnology, inspiring them to ask new questions while also giving me an opportunity to share some of what I’ve learned.  Overall, I left the Science Gallery with a  newfound appreciation for bioart. Although artists may take certain creative liberties that irk scientists, they perform an essential function, especially for getting people who might not otherwise care interested.</p>
<p id="from_dublin_i_">From Dublin, I visited Cathal Garvey, Ireland’s famed biohacker, in Cork and received a lovely tour of his basement lab.  Since my trip to Ireland, I most recently met the Berlin DIYbio group. Unfortunately, this article can only cover a small fraction of my experiences since the last issue; I want future articles to conglomerate experience by category rather than in a fragmented, quasi-chronological fashion. So, as I hop around and see more, I’ll report on European DIYbio next time.</p>

<p id="recently_on_a_">Recently, on a mailing list about open source medical devices, Damon Muma asked the following question: "I am feeling the urge to contribute to this movement, but I’m a bit lost on what has been done/tried/planned or what would be effective and useful.  Worried that efforts would be duplicating others or not usefully focused. I’ve had random friends who aren’t even diabetic but into coding offer to help but wasn’t sure what to point them at."</p>
<p id="my_response_beg">My response began with some fairly concrete observations based on my experiences as a type I diabetic, but it grew to encompass more fundamental issues I know about as a person with an academic background in systems/control theory who works with machine learning techniques as a programmer. I wanted to share those observations here as a way to provoke thought on these questions and broaden the discussion.</p>

<p id="in__the_tr">In 2011, the tragically late Barnaby Jack invited me to share the stage with him a couple times to help him present his insulin pump hacks, where he demonstrated the near-total lack of security in insulin pumps, permitting remote control of all functions with no prior knowledge about an individual pump. He moved on to similar work with pacemakers. I was very much looking forward to his work putting pressure on manufacturers to secure their products, and more broadly to improve their quality standards and innovate a bit in their products' function to produce meaningful progress in patient standards of care (none of which they seem to have much interest in now, certainly not considering the enormous profits they reap from selling the products).</p>

<p id="a_few_months_ag">A few months ago, Medtronic began marketing an incrementally improved model of its pump as an <span class="emphasis"><em>artifical pancreas</em></span>. Until now, in every usage I’m aware of, "artificial pancreas" has meant automatic dosing based mainly on continuous sensor readings. This new pump has the same manual dosing as the old models but adds a feature that cuts off insulin if the patient is trending into hypoglycemia. This is no doubt a useful feature for many diabetics, and I am happy to see it come to market, but suggesting that it has much to do with closed-loop blood glucose control is mere hype, and an insult to the diabetic community’s intelligence, and, I worry, symptomatic of the broad lack of innovation in megacorporatized medicine.</p>
<p id="i_suspect_this_">I suspect this even more because, from my academic background in control theory, I find the control algorithms that appear in the public research I’ve seen on closed-loop blood glucose control to be some of the oldest and least powerful and stable in the field of control. The proportional-integral-derivative (PID) method still appears prominently in the research, even though in the broader field of control, much more powerful and stable approaches such as model-predictive control have been in routine use for decades, and began to appear in closed-loop blood glucose control research during the last 15 years. PID control is distinguished mainly by having origins in the 1890s and being one of the only techniques possible before the invention of practical computers because it fit into the limitations of pneumatic-powered mechanical governor technology. It appears in the early chapters of many textbooks and remains in widespread use in devices such as thermostats—used to solve simple, one-dimensional problems—but it serves mainly as an example of an inadequate approach when there are any subtleties in the problem to overcome. Closed-loop blood glucose control involves many of the most notable of these subtleties, including nonlinearity, long time lags, and very noisy and biased feedback, and would likely benefit from being formulated in a multiple-input, multiple-state, multiple-output way in order to capture the relevant information and reflect the relevant complexities, instead of the one-dimensional formulation that PID is suited to. (For example, a multiple-input formulation would be necessary to use amylin, insulin, and glucagon infusions together to more fully mimic pancreatic function and prevent blood glucose swings at the beginning and end of the insulin dose response.)</p>
<p id="it_seems_from_">It seems, from the outside, like a poorly supported effort organized more around pursuing minimally viable increments to existing products than around taking the technical problem and the goal of producing excellent outcomes for patients seriously on their own terms. There must be many reasons for this, and I speculate that alongside the petty bureaucratic ones, there are even ones based in concerns I would agree are objectively valid. But it is a problem in itself that this all happens out of sight of the main stakeholders in the results: the diabetic patients—that all that reaches the patients is preposterous hype. And in a context of institutionalized science and research and development, it is hard to imagine any significant change in this situation. Opacity and inertia are the default, and in many senses the main objectives, of this form of organization. Only token concessions can be made against them within the paradigm.</p>
<p id="the_community_o">The community of diabetics could work around this apparent bottleneck and aggregate sensor and dose data from patients into an open dataset with which to build models and do offline experiments with proposed algorithms, which is an established methodology in the field. It could then build an ecosystem of open algorithms and hold contests for their improvement and selection. This would become a valuable resource for both institutional and citizen research efforts, and an important resource for checking scientific validity by reproducing results in a field hindered by datasets being mostly proprietary.</p>

<p id="open_sourcing_e">Open sourcing everything required to treat diabetes is the most ambitious and difficult goal. However, it synergizes well with the broader DIYbio movement for two reasons. First, because recombinant insulin was the first major commercial success of biotechnology and set the pattern for future development of biologics. Second, because the tools involved are fundamental to biology and medicine and overlap well with the toolset needed for all serious DIYbio research and other community goals: production and purification of biologics, infusion pumps, and in-vivo <span class="keep-together">sensing.</span></p>

<p id="open_sourcing_t">Open sourcing treatments is also important because pharmaceuticals in general and insulin pumping specifically suffer from very perverse economic incentives that, at least in part, favor keeping people on the treatments with the most disposable or consumable supplies possible, at the highest price relative to the cost of manufacturing. Open source efforts could develop incentives more attuned to encouraging innovations that improve patient outcomes than to encouraging <span class="keep-together">sitting</span> on profits collected from keeping patients addicted to consumable supplies. Some ideas:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist" id="jet_injectors_a_id1"><ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Jet injectors are an established technology to administer insulin that need not use and don’t usually use consumable supplies.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Radio-frequency spectroscopy of body fluid is a means of measuring blood glucose continuously that also doesn’t directly need consumable supplies and has broader applicability to sensing concentrations of other components of body fluids that are of interest to medicine in general and quantified-selfers <span class="keep-together">particularly.</span>
</li>
</ul></div>
<p id="neither_jet_inj">Neither jet injection nor radio-frequency spectroscopy require any complex hardware or exotic materials to implement, so they would make good candidates for open source experimentation. Tim Cannon’s recent <a class="ulink" href="http://www.livescience.com/40892-biohacker-tim-cannon-cyborg.html" target="_top">implantation of a smartphone-sized temperature sensor in his arm</a> also shows that DIY tinkering need not remain strictly noninvasive.</p>
<p id="combining_all_t">Combining all these components into a working system would also result in a platform useful for taking the hypothetical open source closed-loop algorithm research to the point of real tests.</p>

<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title">Economics of Effective Health Care and Scientific Research</h2></div></div></div>
<p id="the_financial_c">The financial crisis of 2008 opened discussions on many economic topics of interest to medicine, but I have seen little public discussion taking advantage of the insights that arose in the broader economic discussions.</p>
<p id="one_issue_is_th">One issue is the kinds of incentives mentioned before in relation to consumable supplies. They need to be realigned to provide economic benefits to caregivers based on the health of the patient (the true goal) rather than on the amount or cost of services provided (which clearly should be minimized as long as the goal of patient health is achieved, both to minimize direct cost and to minimize risk of iatrogenics). In his 2008 essay in <span class="emphasis"><em>Harper’s Magazine</em></span> entitled "Our Phony Economy," Jonathan Rowe described the problem well:</p>
<div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p id="current_modes_o">Current modes of economic measurement focus almost entirely on means…The medical system is the same. The aim should be healthy people, not the sale of more medical services and drugs. Now, however, we assess the economic contribution of the medical system on the basis of treatments rather than results. Economists see nothing wrong with this. They see no problem that the medical system is expected to produce 30 to 40 percent of new jobs over the next thirty years. "We have to spend our money on something," shrugged a Stanford economist to the <span class="emphasis"><em>New York Times</em></span>. This is more insanity. Next we will be hearing about "disease-led recovery." To stimulate the economy we will have to encourage people to be sick so that the economy can be well.</p></blockquote></div>
<p id="the_grim_realit">The grim reality may be that we are already many decades deep into doing this—the perverse incentives have prevailed for at least that long.</p>
<p id="perhaps_this_ca">Perhaps this can be addressed by aligning the interests of patients and caregivers by paying doctors only when their patients are well. This is sometimes said to have been the custom in premodern China and precolonial India. And perhaps this can be done under the structure of lodge practice, which was a common <span class="keep-together">and successful</span> structure for the provision of health care before the New Deal in <span class="keep-together">America.</span><a href="#ftn.id467218" class="footnote"><sup class="footnote" id="id467218">[6]</sup></a></p>
<p id="as_for_the_rese">As for the research itself, in his talk entitled "On Bureaucratic Technologies &amp; The Future as Dreamtime," David Graeber put the problem this way: "Even though we’ve been pouring our research money into medicine we still don’t have a cure for cancer. But we do have Ritalin, and Zoloft, and Prozac, all these things that basically make people not go completely insane despite the intense work regime they are now under." And after noting the decline in the pace of scientific discoveries after the US succeeded the UK as global hegemon and bureaucratic institutions and corporations began to dominate as a result, he stated:</p>
<div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p id="if_you_look_at_">If you look at where did a lot of these discoveries actually come from in the UK, they didn’t come from institutions. A lot of them came from things like rural vicars. You know, sort of eccentrics of society, they put them somewhere where they only had to do something once a week, and they would, like, study the insect life, or work on their strange theories of whatever it might be, and 90% of them were completely crazy, but 10%, that’s where the patents came out of, that’s where discoveries largely came out of.</p></blockquote></div>
<p id="graeber_then_qu">Graeber then quoted astrophysicist Jonathan Katz’s essay entitled, "Don’t Become a Scientist," where Katz said, "It is proverbial that original ideas are the kiss of death for a proposal because they have not yet been proved to work." Graeber continued:</p>
<div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p id="if_you_want_to_">If you want to actually come up with an unexpected breakthrough…you get a bunch of creative people, you give them whatever they want, whatever resources they need, and you leave them alone for a while. After a while you come back and most of them aren’t going to come up with anything but one or two will come up with something you would have never imagined. If you want to make absolutely sure that innovative breakthroughs never happen, what you do is you say, OK, none of you guys get any resources at all unless you spend most of your time competing with one another to convince me that you already know what you’re going to discover.</p></blockquote></div>
<p id="the_case_for_pu">The case for putting serious money into citizen science turns out to be quite pragmatic.</p>
<p id="indeed_the_mod">Indeed, the modern research university was largely an innovation of the early modern French empire, adopted by Frederick William III’s Prussia and further refined into a tool for centralizing control of the Prussian intellectual culture. The totalitarian Prussian regime needed such a tool to serve its agenda of maintaining an obedient and rigidly regimented army to hire out to other warring powers as mercenaries or, that failing, to threaten them directly. Another contemporary innovation of that regime was to require all women to register their menses with the police so that the population’s fertility could be optimized, a fact noted by John Taylor Gatto in his <span class="emphasis"><em>Underground History of American Education</em></span>.<a href="#ftn.id467310" class="footnote"><sup class="footnote" id="id467310">[7]</sup></a> The Americans who imported the research university system to America looked explicitly to such precedents as inspirational successes.<a href="#ftn.id467322" class="footnote"><sup class="footnote" id="id467322">[8]</sup></a> With our knowledge of what disastrous results these institutions ultimately contributed to in the German state that succeeded Prussia, we should be able to set a better course for ourselves than the people who committed these errors.</p>

<p id="it_turns_out_th">It turns out that the statistical methods used to evaluate scientific research were born out of many of the same authoritarian, high-modern impulses (to use the terminology of Yale anthropologist James C. Scott) that drove the bureaucratization and corporatization of the economy. The two people who contributed the most to the currently dominant way of statistically testing hypotheses, Ronald Fisher and Karl Pearson, were ardent eugenicists, and though it is only a circumstantial observation, it is worth noting that eugenics' pretenses of rationality are based entirely on selective and specious interpretations of data, on grossly oversimplified and unjustifiedly optimistic beliefs about the effects of destructive interventions, and on mistaking correlation for causation as a matter of course. Even so, Fisher warned that his test of significance should not be used to come to scientific conclusions, but rather as a tool to guide the intuition and as a possible first step before formulating a more rigorous analysis specific to the problem at hand and more sensitive to ambiguities inherent in real situations. Fisher feuded with proponents of a rival methodology, Neyman and a younger Pearson, about the correct way to draw statistical inferences until the end of his life in 1962. A hybrid of the two methods that none of them intended became the version generally taught and used. It came under criticism from Bayesian and other perspectives, and the controversy over this methodological question and many others continues in journals in several fields alongside the results supposedly vetted by the controversial methods.<a href="#ftn.id467361" class="footnote"><sup class="footnote" id="id467361">[9]</sup></a></p>
<p id="more_recently_">More recently, in 2005, John Ioannidis of Stanford surveyed the situation and explained "Why Most Published Research Findings Are False" in his publication of the same name, considering medicine specifically, commenting that, "for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias."  Starting around 2010, Stephanie Seneff of MIT found that statin treatment for high cholesterol may be counterproductive overall and may include extreme iatrogenic risks and identified fallacious reasoning and failures to reproduce in many key research findings in favor of treatment.<a href="#ftn.id467383" class="footnote"><sup class="footnote" id="id467383">[10]</sup></a>  However, Lipitor, a statin, "is the world’s all-time biggest selling prescription medicine with cumulative sales topping $130 billion," and about 20 million Americans are taking statins now.<a href="#ftn.id467397" class="footnote"><sup class="footnote" id="id467397">[11]</sup></a> In 2012, Samuel Arbesman studied the turnover in scientific beliefs and cited research by Poynard et. al. finding that the half-life of a fact in the fields cirrhosis and hepatitis is about 45 years, and therefore about half of the ostensible facts a typical adult could have supposedly known about those fields during the time studied were false. <a href="#ftn.id467414" class="footnote"><sup class="footnote" id="id467414">[12]</sup></a> In a 2013 draft, Spyros Makridakis of INSEAD found no benefit, but only risk, in most cases of treatment of hypertension according to prevailing medical guidelines, and no evident overall benefit to life expectancy in treatment across the whole population.<a href="#ftn.id467431" class="footnote"><sup class="footnote" id="id467431">[13]</sup></a></p>
<p id="the_litany_cont">The litany continues in the introduction to a recent issue of <span class="emphasis"><em>The Economist</em></span> dedicated to "How Science Goes Wrong":<a href="#ftn.id467448" class="footnote"><sup class="footnote" id="id467448">[14]</sup></a></p>
<div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p id="a_rule_of_thumb">A rule of thumb among biotechnology venture-capitalists is that half of published research cannot be replicated. Even that may be optimistic. Last year researchers at one biotech firm, Amgen, found they could reproduce just six of 53 “landmark” studies in cancer research. Earlier, a group at Bayer, a drug company, managed to repeat just a quarter of 67 similarly important papers. A leading computer scientist frets that three-quarters of papers in his subfield are bunk. In 2000-10 roughly 80,000 patients took part in clinical trials based on research that was later retracted because of mistakes or <span class="keep-together">improprieties.</span></p></blockquote></div>
<p id="meanwhile_bart">Meanwhile, Bart Kosko compares the dominant use of probability models that accommodate easy analytical manipulation, and more broadly, reliance on probability theory itself rather than broader classes of models of uncertainty, to the proverbial drunk who searches beneath the light of the street lamp for lost keys rather than where they were last seen, off in the dark.<a href="#ftn.id467480" class="footnote"><sup class="footnote" id="id467480">[15]</sup></a></p>
<p id="from_all_this_">From all this, I conclude that we have nothing like a reliable mechanism for drawing useful conclusions from data in any but the simplest of situations, certainly not in those encountered in biology or medicine, and that many mistakes are hidden and frauds are perpetrated by use of distracting and impressive but meaningless rituals. I expect that someday, historians of science, and perhaps any student of the history of our times, will be aghast at all the waste and suffering we have inflicted upon ourselves in this way. The question of what mechanism should be used, if even one should be used, to generate useful scientific results merits much more attention than the negligible amount it currently gets. (But it has a fair amount of mine already.)</p>

<p id="nassim_taleb_of">Nassim Taleb offers the core of a respectable answer in his advocacy of what he calls, in the terms of his pragmatic philosophy, convex tinkering. He has built the most recent phase of his career on promoting his pragmatism and the phase before that on predicting and profiting personally from predicting the financial collapse of 2008, but the need for his insights might be most urgent in medicine. He stresses the limits to knowledge in drawing distinctions between the knowable and the unknowable that are unaccounted for by the most commonly applied statistical techniques, which assume away such dangers a priori, and even usually <span class="keep-together">book unmodeled</span> variation towards the confirmation of the hypothesis under <span class="keep-together">consideration</span>. From there, he advocates all feasible control over the consequences one derives from unknowable events, making them beneficial if possible and avoiding them otherwise. In research, this amounts to much broad tinkering under conditions where successes can be noticed and turned to benefit but failures lead to no great loss, rather than high-overhead, high-stakes, overwrought, top-down research agendas. Science and medicine deserve to be practiced accordingly, as it turns out they consistently have been in their most successful embodiments since ancient times. As Graeber’s observations suggest, citizen science will do so where institutional science has failed to do so.</p>

<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">Conflicting Images</h3></div></div></div>
<p id="ask_someone_the">Ask someone the first thing that comes to mind when considering biohacking and accidents, and you’ll get impressions that fall into roughly two groups. One group, from the uninitiated public, might sound like a summer movie thriller all about killer viruses cut and pasted together in dank basement laboratories escaping into the wild. The other group, coming from DIYbio practitioners, is more prosaic and is concerned with handling broken glassware, containing spills, and best practices for cleaning up biohazards. These conflicting images—and the different perceptions of biohacking at the root—are worth a detailed look themselves. Happily, both sets of concerns can be addressed, at least on a basic level, with good laboratory safety practices. Having a safe home lab involves many practical elements—lab location, personal protection, anticipating problems, common safety equipment, and best lab practices—but we’ll start with one of the least practical but most asked about pieces: what is legal? We’ll tackle some of these other issues in future editions of BioCoder.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2" id="_kinds_of_labs">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">Kinds of Labs</h3></div></div></div>
<p id="home_labs_are_d">Home labs are different from community labs, such as BioCurious and Genspace, and other public maker spaces where several people come together to share access to tools and ideas. And there are even other differences with commercial and <span class="keep-together">academic</span> labs. These differences mostly work in the favor of the home experimenter. Or at least they make it simpler to start a home lab:</p>
<div class="variablelist" id="simplicity_resp"><dl class="variablelist">
<dt><span class="term">
Simplicity
</span></dt>
<dd>
Responsibility for the home labspace generally rests with one individual, who also controls access and supervises use.
</dd>
<dt><span class="term">
Privacy
</span></dt>
<dd>
Home labs are private, and users don’t need to worry as much about public perception, scrutiny, strict adherence to regulations often meant to cover commercial spaces and paid employees, or worries about public access and liability. Like anything, there are tradeoffs here, too. Having just one set of eyes on a problem means that a lot of solutions get missed. And not worrying about public perception or getting a pass on commercial regulations doesn’t mean that they’re not good ideas. Even a home lab is required to protect other people present in your home, your neighbors, and the environment.
</dd>
</dl></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2" id="_breaking_the_law">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">Breaking the Law</h3></div></div></div>
<p id="this_is_actuall">This is actually hard to do. Surprisingly, there are few formal regulations dealing with amateur labs or typical research in biotechnology. At least, this is currently true for the United States; YMMV in other countries.  For instance, in Ireland, genetic engineering labs must be licensed by the Irish Environmental Protection Agency—biohacker Cathal Garvey registered his parents' house as a Class 1 lab so he could genetically manipulate microbes of “negligible risk” legally. Even in the US, there is a patchwork of regulations dependent on where you live, although this is the exception rather than the rule.  In California, at the state level, human reproductive cloning is banned, with a fine of $1 million levied for violations, making it prohibitively expensive to raise a large clone army in the Golden State. (Protip: Nevada does not even prohibit the use of state funds for human cloning, borders California, and the available huge tracts of desert land may be more suitable for a secret underground lair.) Note that most of these laws have monetary fines rather than criminal penalties. A few federal regulations exist, but most of these also lack criminal teeth. They use the carrot of federal funding to enforce experimental standards or restrictions. Bans on funding for reproductive human cloning and the reversed ban on using particular cell lines for stem cell research are good examples of using funding carrots to enforce limits on research.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2" id="_what_happens_in_the_lab_stays_in_the_lab">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">What Happens in the Lab Stays in the Lab</h3></div></div></div>
<p id="the_concept_of_">The concept of biosafety levels (BSL) falls into the same general basket—it’s not a formal regulation, but it carries considerable weight. BSL is a set of lab safety criteria put forth by the Department of Health and Human Services’ (HHS) Centers for Disease Control (CDC). There is no regulation that requires labs to use these standards and no government authority that issues permits. But a lab that is not in compliance may be denied government funding or can face other obstacles to working with institutions.</p>
<div class="sidebar" id="the_bsl_standar_id1">
<div class="titlepage"></div>
<p id="the_bsl_standar_id2">The BSL standard is not a regulation, but a set of guidelines, voluntarily adopted by many labs to guard against the spread of potentially harmful organisms under study. Biosafety levels come in four flavors: BSL-1 through BSL-4, with each higher level building a more strict set of precautions, affecting facilities, personal protection, and procedures for doing increasingly serious work while still protecting lab personnel and the environment:</p>
<div class="variablelist" id="bsl_work_with"><dl class="variablelist">
<dt><span class="term">
BSL-1
</span></dt>
<dd>
Work with non-disease–causing microbes (e.g., E. coli K-12), on an open lab bench, with just a lab coat and maybe gloves and lab goggles for protection. Work surfaces are sterilized. This describes the vast majority of biohacker labs.
</dd>
<dt><span class="term">
BSL-2
</span></dt>
<dd>
Organisms posing a small threat to people or the environment are handled (e.g., <span class="emphasis"><em>Staphylococcus aureus</em></span>), typically in a controlled access lab with enhanced protection, biosafety cabinets, and decontamination equipment available.
</dd>
<dt><span class="term">
BSL-3
</span></dt>
<dd>
Serious work with organisms that can be deadly if inhaled (e.g., <span class="emphasis"><em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em></span>). Researchers may get special immunizations, wear respirators, and enter the negative-pressure lab through airlocks.
</dd>
<dt><span class="term">
BSL-4
</span></dt>
<dd>
Extremely serious work with dangerous, exotic organisms (e.g., Ebola), done with glove boxes or in bunny suits. Think <span class="emphasis"><em>The Andromeda Strain</em></span> without the self-destruct switch.
</dd>
</dl></div>
<p id="there_are_speci">There are special versions of the BSL guidelines for facilities with animals and plants, designed to protect against the spread of animal disease and plant pests, particularly ones that might affect the agricultural economy. Hollywood sometimes features a fictional BSL-5 for really terrifying, alien invasion–type biohazards, a sort of “it goes to 11” bioclassification. Don’t be fooled—BSL-4 is where it tops out in the real world.</p>
</div>
<p id="and_its_just_a">And it’s just a good idea—the BSL matches sets of facilities and procedures to levels of risk in handling hazardous organisms and is almost universally useful. Lots of biohacker labs adopt some version of the BSL-1 standards. It’s a good way to ensure that what happens in the lab stays in the lab. At least be familiar with the specific requirements for a BSL-1 lab and use the parts that will work for your situation. One big implication of having a BSL-1 lab: you limit yourself to not working with human bodily fluids, including spit samples and blood spots, and you can’t host mammalian cell cultures or microbial cultures of unknown origin. This is because any sample could, unbeknownst to you, contain disease vectors that would require BSL-2+ precautions.</p>
<p id="the_one_area_of">The one area of US federal law that does have some serious and specific restrictions for biologists—and carries criminal and civil penalties—is working with organisms on the Select Agents and Toxins list. These are almost all organisms that either cause serious human disease or could devastate commercial agriculture; Yersinia pestis (Black Death) bacteria, ricin toxin, and foot-and-mouth disease virus are all on the list. Working with these legally requires special permission and facilities. Again, steering clear of this list falls under the heading of “just a good idea.”</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2" id="_gene_tinkering">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">Gene Tinkering</h3></div></div></div>
<p id="again_possibly">Again, possibly surprisingly, there are few laws in the US restricting the use of genetic engineering or synthetic biology to alter the DNA of living creatures. Up until now, this field has mostly been restricted to academics and commercial professionals and has depended largely on self-regulation and liability concerns to keep risk to a minimum. In a nutshell, roughly and approximately, you’re within the law if you’re not:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist" id="working_with_or_id1"><ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Working with organisms or DNA on the Select Agents list
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Selling or distributing or doing environmental release of GE drugs, food, or plant pests
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Increasing the resistance or communicability of health hazards or invasive <span class="keep-together">species</span>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Releasing harmful GE organisms into the environment (exactly what “harmful” means is open to some interpretation)
</li>
</ul></div>
<p id="the_regulatory_">The regulatory agencies are the FDA, EPA, and USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS). Regulation in this area is a mess, and it’s quickly evolving. Documents exist ranging from the most complete NIH Guidelines to the fictionally derived Pledge for Genetic Engineers. One request: don’t give authorities a reason to harshly reassess the current stance toward self-regulation established after the historic Asilomar Conference on Recombinant DNA in 1975. Again, there is some state and local variation in these laws.</p>
<p id="a_couple_of_exa">A couple of examples: on a county level, it is “unlawful for any person, firm, or corporation to propagate, cultivate, raise, or grow genetically modified organisms in Mendocino County,” California, ostensibly to protect the organic status of crops grown in the region. Violators have had their GE crops destroyed by the government. Somewhat ironically, Mendocino is the source of a large portion of the state’s marijuana crop and is a place where authorizes are more likely to take a torch to your GE soybeans than your field of weed. Also, as a city-level example, in Walpole, Massachusetts, performing genetic engineering work requires an annual $5 permit, which is not burdensome in itself, but has specific requirements about filing lab floor plans, procedures, training, inspections, and the formation of an institutional biosafety committee (IBC).</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2" id="_taking_out_the_trash">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">Taking Out the Trash</h3></div></div></div>
<p id="what_will_proba">What will probably have more impact on you is where you interface with your local utilities and services infrastructure. Most local governments (at the city, county, or water district level) have regulations about what’s OK to dump down the sewer or throw in the trash. What is hazardous, and how do you dispose of it? The short answer is: if you’d be uncomfortable spilling it on your dining room table, don’t just flush it or throw it away. Check with your local water and trash authorities about the best way to proceed. For instance, most water authorities require that residential wastewater result from basic activities like washing and not contain hazardous waste. Specific restrictions may include things like allowable range of pH, anything that can catch on fire, materials that might cause obstructions, and even the color of the water.</p>
<p id="hazardous_chemi">Hazardous chemicals are worth their own long, tedious discussion. Hazardous chemicals include substances that meet certain criteria for ignitability, corrosivity, reactivity, radioactivity, and toxicity (including anything  containing heavy metals, halogenated organics, greases, and oils). Most bioresearch does not use hazardous substances (with a few exceptions, which are a good idea to shun). Ethidium bromide (often abbreviated EtBr) has been in widespread use for staining gels in DNA work and gel electrophoresis; it’s thought to be a mutagen, or cancer causing, and in the right (or wrong) concentrations can require special handling and disposal. Use safer alternatives like GelGreen, GelRed, and SYBR Safe. Polyacrylamide gels are made from acrylamide, which is a potent neurotoxin. The possibility of contaminating yourself when mixing up polyacrylamide, or of there being free acrylamide in a gel, should be enough to make you want to switch to agarose gels.</p>
<p id="biohazardous_wa">Biohazardous waste is confusing. It can be hard to define, as different institutions have different definitions of what constitutes a biohazard. And it’s very possible that your local trash authorities don’t have a lot of experience with this and may be prone to overreact if you approach them with biohazardous waste questions. For the purposes of a home lab, doing BSL-1 work, you can minimize your risks here by treating anything that lives or grows, or anything that touches it, as a biohazard. This means that bacterial cultures, fungus, mold, and growth media as well as countertops, gloves, lab coats, and instruments need to be sterilized or disposed of as biohazardous waste. Taken to extremes, this means that spitting on the floor is a biohazard (and not just rude) and that a puppy “accident” is a biohazard. This seems a ridiculous stretch. But context matters. Spitting on the floor in your home lab should be treated as a biohazard. So should puppy poop, if the puppy is genetically engineered but hasn’t been vetted for general environmental release (also, call me—I’ve got a killer idea for glow-in-the-dark miniature Irish wolfhounds). Practically speaking, if you sterilize biohazardous waste, then you just have waste, and that you can throw away or flush. You can sterilize with chemicals or heat.</p>
<p id="to_sterilize_wi">To sterilize with heat, use an instrument called an autoclave. On the plus side, autoclaves can also be used to sterilize growth media or glassware and are appropriate for sterilizing small amounts of biowaste. On the minus side, they’re moderately expensive, even on the resale market, and have their own sets of risks for operators (they’re commonly described as “pressure cookers from hell”).</p>
<p id="most_home_lab_o">Most home lab operators use chemicals. Soaking liquid biowaste in a fresh 10% bleach solution for at least 20 minutes before flushing the whole solution should inactivate anything biological. But don’t flush gloves or pipette tips or containers. At worst, you can find a commercial waste disposal service that will pick up your bag of biowaste for around $100. Local authorities may have specific regulations about the amounts of hazardous chemicals (including flammables like alcohol) you can store in one place, about how and where certain chemicals and waste are stored, and how much and how long biohazardous waste can be stored before it’s treated. Know before you grow—check with your local authorities. County or commercial waste handlers are a really good place to start.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2" id="_liability">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">Liability</h3></div></div></div>
<p id="finally_in_the">Finally, in the US, the last resort when people are hurt or property is damaged is often hiring a lawyer and suing someone. If you burn down your apartment building, it really doesn’t matter if it’s from a lamp you badly rewired or if you left an alcohol lamp burning—something you could have prevented burnt several homes to the ground, and you may be liable. Even more so if your synthetic bioscience project starts spreading like crabgrass. Aside from giving general advice like, “Don’t let that happen,” I’ll just say you can minimize your risk here by making sure you are following good lab and safety practices. Even though the BSL guidelines are just guidelines, scientists are often judged on how well they follow them. And it’s good to know what your home or renter’s insurance covers. If you’re pursuing a hobby in your garage, you may be covered. If you’re an inventor and want to commercialize, or if you are actually running a small business out of your home, you will likely need a rider on that home insurance. And if you’re running a business in any way connected to a lab, there’s a whole other set of laws you’ll need to know about for employees, safety training, and OSHA regulations.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2" id="_don_t_just_listen_to_me">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">Don’t Just Listen To Me…</h3></div></div></div>
<p id="finally_if_you">Finally, if you’re doing something that may affect life and limb and livelihood, don’t trust some random guy on the Internet. I am not a lawyer, and I’m not offering legal advice or opinions here, but rather encouraging you to seek out the proper authorities, consult more resources, and make your own evaluations. If you really want to know more, find other biohackers. Engaging with the biohacker community is the single best way to quickly learn better practices and improve your knowledge and your abilities. If there’s not an active biohacker group where you live, start one—host a meetup. At worst, connect with like-minded folks on the Internet. The DIYbio group hosts a service called “Ask a Biosafety Expert” for questions like the ones that we’re making a start on answering here. Another sterling resource is your local university. They likely have an Environmental Health and Safety (EH&amp;S) office that does some sort of safety training and sets requirements for labs on campus. A polite, short list of questions about how they handle biosafety for microbiology and molecular biology labs can yield wonders. Ask for a checklist or to sit in on training. Other good synergies can come out of working with the right people at nearby schools.</p>
<p id="so_really_don">So, really don’t just listen to me. Please constructively question and challenge the things listed here. For one thing, I left out more than I included. For another, anything that has to do with safety and security works best when it’s out in the open, with multiple viewpoints considered and discussed. If you’re just starting a home lab, and especially if you’re trying to convince a spouse or roommate that it’s a good idea, saying, “Well, it’s mostly not illegal” may not be the best ammunition. But it is good to know, especially if it’s a starting-off place for finding more resources in your community. And if this is useful, I’m hoping we can discuss more considerations for home biohacker labs, and especially more enabling and practical topics, in coming issues of BioCoder.</p>

<p id="i_am_indebted_t">I am indebted to Josh Perfetto, the founding Safety Officer at BioCurious, for much knowledge about this area, and for many discussions (and sometimes arguments) about the balance between proper safety precautions and freedom of scientific inquiry. When he left active participation at BioCurious, many of his duties fell to me, and I now appreciate his stance more than ever. It’s more fun to argue for what everyone should be allowed to do, but much more productive to find a middle way that appropriately minimizes risk. Thank you, Josh, for starting us off right.</p>

<p id="synthetic_biolo">Synthetic biology has had profound effects on human life. It has provided more effective anti-malarial medicine, cheaper insulin, new useful biomaterials, and greener biofuels. However, much remains to be learned in order to synthesize proteins more efficiently. To explore the potential of the DIY biology movement to engage in meaningful synthetic biology bioinformatics research, we developed a bioinformatics workshop to study determinants of protein expression levels in plants. We extracted possible ribosome binding and translation initiation sequences and looked for correlations with experimentally determined protein levels using publicly available datasets for the widely studied plants <span class="emphasis"><em>Oryza sativa</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>Arabidopsis thaliana</em></span>. The working group was open to the public and met every other week for three hours, typically starting with a short, relevant presentation followed by hands-on data work. We aim to develop, experimentally validate, and publish our consensus sequences, anticipating that our work will be useful for plant synthetic biology research. We hope our experience will be a model for future community projects that serve the dual purpose of educating curious members of the public while also generating useful scientific results.</p>

<div class="sect1" data-original-filename="Second-Issue_-BioCoderv1_2_PlantParts_Workshop.asciidoc" id="_introduction">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title">Introduction</h2></div></div></div>
<p id="advances_in_seq">Advances in sequencing technology have produced an avalanche of biological data over the past 12 years. The bottleneck in discovery has consequently shifted from data generation to data analysis, suggesting that much data is not used to its full potential.<a href="#ftn.id468453" class="footnote"><sup class="footnote" id="id468453">[16]</sup></a></p>
<p id="crowdsourcing_i">Crowdsourcing is one technique used to gain more insight from existing biological data. Putting the diverse eyes and hands of the general public to the purpose of bioinformatics is not new.<a href="#ftn.id468466" class="footnote"><sup class="footnote" id="id468466">[17]</sup></a> Examples include protein<a href="#ftn.id468479" class="footnote"><sup class="footnote" id="id468479">[18]</sup></a> and <a class="ulink" href="http://eterna.cmu.edu/web/" target="_top">RNA folding</a>, and both paid <a class="ulink" href="http://www.ingenuity.com" target="_top">Ingenuity Systems</a> and unpaid<a href="#ftn.id468498" class="footnote"><sup class="footnote" id="id468498">[19]</sup></a> curation of literature.</p>
<p id="rather_than_app">Rather than approach a problem strictly as professionals, we developed an open source DIY workshop where scientists and the public worked together to tackle a synthetic biology project resulting in a publishable outcome. The problem to be solved would need data from completely open sources and not require difficult analysis. A modest goal was set to do a survey of plant translation initiation motifs, aiming to create an open source parts list for controlling translation in metabolic engineering and synthetic biology. Working meetings were posted through Counter Culture Labs and Berkeley Bio Labs (groups with &gt;100 members each) on Meetup.com and met every week or two over three months.</p>
<p id="plants_offer_ma">Plants offer many advantages as systems to do fine-tuned biological engineering (e.g., modification to enhance production of economically valuable terpinoid,<a href="#ftn.id468527" class="footnote"><sup class="footnote" id="id468527">[20]</sup></a> or modification of lignin biosynthesis to expedite biofuel synthesis<a href="#ftn.id468536" class="footnote"><sup class="footnote" id="id468536">[21]</sup></a>). There is a paucity of published information, however, on how to control sets of genes working in concert. Use of small sequence motifs as ribosome binding site parts for synthetic biology has been proposed in bacteria,<a href="#ftn.id468546" class="footnote"><sup class="footnote" id="id468546">[22]</sup></a> and <a class="ulink" href="http://parts.igem.org" target="_top">similar parts have been produced for yeast</a>. Estimates for RBS parts in prokaryotic systems show that the translation level of a gene can be shifted by greater than an order of magnitude, indicating their potential utility in synthetic biology projects. Generating an estimate of the regulatory power of plant translation initiation motifs was thus seen as a useful goal for our project.</p>
<p id="in_most_eukaryo">In most eukaryotic plant genes, the 5' cap of the mRNA transcript acts as the ribosome binding site and the Kozak sequence acts as the signal for translation initiation. Due to the bacterial origins of the chloroplast, transcripts of genes encoded within the chloroplast genome contain distinct consensus sequences in comparison to transcripts from the nucleus. Instead of the 5' cap, there is a short motif called the Shine-Delgarno sequence where the ribosome binds and then initiates translation, generally eight nucleotides downstream, though this distance varies. Although there has been some experimental work on ribosome binding sites and Kozak sequences in plants,<a href="#ftn.id468579" class="footnote"><sup class="footnote" id="id468579">[23]</sup></a> genomic-scale surveys have not been performed.</p>
<p id="here_we_use_pub">Here we use publicly available, combined RNA- and protein-expression data for both nuclear and chloroplast genes to estimate the power of the ribosome binding and translation initiation sequence motifs to initiate translation. These are initial results; experimental confirmation of the motifs will follow.</p>

In order to capture translation initiation motifs as well as possible leader peptide sequences, the gene description GFF files were used to extract the 25 bases before and 18 bases after the start codon of each gene for each genome build. The terms "CDS" or "mRNA" were used to extract protein coding regions. With the data from the rice genome, we were unable to separate coding sequences in all three possible reading frames; therefore, we excluded coding sequences that did not initiate with the canonical "ATG" start codon.</p>

<p id="the_correlation">The correlation between mRNA and protein available in the cell turned out to be poor—the mRNA and proteome scores had a correlation of 0.12, which implies that there are likely several factors that are influencing both of these numbers that go into Θ, indicating that the model is too simple.</p>

<p id="though_the_work">Though the workshop has performed some novel analyses, this is a preliminary work. It’s clear the estimate of transcript initiation has a tremendous amount of uncertainty associated with it. Microarray probe sets are not distinctly comparable with each other, as the specific sequences of the probes vary in their target affinity.</p>
<p id="an_abundance_of">An abundance of cell processes can affect the actual amount of protein produced compared to the mRNA reported by a microarray. Just a few of these may include nonsense mediated decay, inhibitory RNA, post-translational editing, protein sorting among cellular compartments, and secondary structure in the mRNA.</p>
<p id="still_for_the_l">Still for the largest and smallest Θ values, the values determined might give some correlation with strong and weak translation. We will next test the leader sequences associated with the largest transcription initiation power in vivo in collaboration with the Glowing Plant project. To this end, we’ll be taking the motifs for the 10 largest and some smaller Θ motifs and installing the sequence into a plasmid that can be validated in a plant cell by quantitation of florescence from a GFP versus a control construct with its current constitutive motif sequence. When their relative strengths have been determined, the parts themselves will be placed in the GoldenBraid public repository.<a href="#ftn.id469235" class="footnote"><sup class="footnote" id="id469235">[39]</sup></a></p>
<p id="the_collection_">The collection of motifs will also enable us to examine chloroplast Shine-Delgarno sequences and their relative effects on translation.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2" id="_open_workshop">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">Open Workshop</h3></div></div></div>
<p id="one_of_us_ron_">One of us (Ron Shigeta) initiated the open workshop as an experiment to bring together the populations of curious laymen, experienced wet biologists, and software engineering talent in the East Bay area, and all three of these groups were represented in the attendees. In addition, several working bioinformaticians <span class="keep-together">contributed.</span></p>
<p id="the_project_was">The project was structured to give an introduction and purpose to looking at a variety of publicly available biological data. The first five meetings each were spent on a category of biological data: chromosomal sequences, individual open reading frames, microarray data, quantitative proteomics data in 2D polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and quantitative proteome data from gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy. In each of these sessions, data was gathered from public sources, and participants had hands-on experience with the raw data. Attendance ranged from 25 to 30 participants. As a public-scientific–interface event, hands-on work with data and computers was quite engaging, and several useful scripts were written to process the data in Python and R.</p>
<p id="the_following_t_id2">The following two months of biweekly data analysis sessions were less fully attended, with an average of two to four participants. Possible reasons for this decline include lack of understanding of the subject matter or technical skills needed to fully participate, inability to commit to an extended project, and unclear direction or incentives to continue. The more open-ended nature of data interpretation and analysis is also a difficult process to relate to an introductory course; it was difficult for newcomers to biology to attach to these tasks.</p>
<p id="future_workshop">Future workshops may be structured into beginner, intermediate, and advanced levels that would be more accessible to participants from diverse educational backgrounds and will likely be shorter in length to reduce attrition. Another idea is to take on a project with the sole goal of doing that project, rather than anticipating publishable results. As an experiment, the workshop did succeed in bringing together a range of talent and covered a broad set of biological data.</p>

<p id="if_you_have_eve">If you have ever played fetch with a dog or hide-and-seek with a particularly crafty cat, then you have played a biological game.  In fact, humanity has a long and morally complex history of games and rituals involving other organisms, from the bull leapers of the Minoan civilization to the chariot races of ancient Rome.  Now, through the application of biotechnology, such games are beginning to extend into the microscopic world, illuminating new opportunities for entertainment, education, and the understanding of ourselves as ethical and social creatures within the larger community of life.</p>
<p id="it_was_about_a_">It was about a year ago that I first heard the term “biotic games” during a workshop at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.genspace.org" target="_top">Genspace</a> exploring the <a class="ulink" href="http://www.stanford.edu/group/riedel-kruse/research/biotic_games.html" target="_top">research of Stanford’s Dr. Ingmar Riedel-Kruse</a>, in which unicellular paramecium are manipulated via electric currents in order to play Atari-style games such as Pac-Man and Pong.  Dr. Ellen Jorgensen and computer engineer Geva Patz demonstrated this behavioral response to electricity, known as galvanotaxis, by placing paramecia in an area bounded by four electrodes—as one of the electrodes became negatively charged, the paramecia swam in its direction, only to make a u-turn as this electrode became positive and another negative.  This immediately sparked in my mind the wonders of the 1982 landmark film <span class="emphasis"><em>Tron</em></span> (which, in turn, was inspired by Pong): beings in the machine, tiny organisms living out their own lives, yet contributing to a grander process.</p>
<p id="having_spent_ma">Having spent many years developing games and interactive media, both for computers and mobile devices, the potential impact of this technology became quickly apparent to me—not just in gameplay, but also in terms of possibilities for living, interactive art projects as well as interesting social commentary.  Much has been said, for instance, about the relationship between the player of a game and his avatar within the game: do you control the avatar, or do you become the avatar?  What does it mean if your avatar is actually another living organism?  The incorporation of life into gaming also has the potential to promote thoughtful reflection about humanity’s relationship to nature and the prospect of interspecies cooperation, working to combat the stigma of dehumanization and desensitization commonly attributed to video games in general.  Other members at Genspace were of similar mind, and together, Dr. Oliver Medvedik, cofounder of Genspace, Sarah Choukah, Genspace member and PhD communications student, and myself decided to pool our respective expertise in biology, microcontrollers, and game development to take this technology to the next level.</p>
<p id="the_first_desig">The first design decision we made was to use an iPhone as the game platform (see <a class="xref" href="ch09.html#pacman_0101" title="Figure 9-1. iPhone with microscope attachment positioned above paramecia stage">Figure 9-1</a>), unlike Dr. Riedel-Kruse’s original model, which relied on a desktop-based Adobe Flash interface.  We made this choice both because we wanted the unit to be portable, and because we felt that having the game run on such a ubiquitous device would make the underlying technology more real to the populace, rather than just a scientific curiosity.  This approach was not without its drawbacks, however, as the intense graphical processing required to motion-track multiple paramecia is difficult to pull off on relatively limited mobile platforms.  While I was thus busy trying to wrangle the iPhone to this purpose, Oliver and Sarah had their own hands full with engineering the control mechanism.  Complicating our respective issues was the fact that the <a class="ulink" href="http://worldsciencefestival.com/events/innovation_square" target="_top">2013 World Science Festival at Innovation Square</a> was set to begin just one week after we had embarked on our project, and we really wanted to present.</p>
<div class="figure" id="pacman_0101">

<div class="figure-title">Figure 9-1. iPhone with microscope attachment positioned above paramecia stage</div>
</div>
<p id="sometimes_scien">Sometimes science is conducted in an orderly manner, with lab coats and latex gloves, and sometimes science is conducted frantically into the wee hours over half-eaten boxes of pizza and flashing LED lights.  This was the latter.  But it had worked—after a solid trifecta of all-nighters, we possessed an operational prototype.  Using barely more than electrical contacts and assorted Lego blocks, Oliver and Sarah had created a basic joystick, which was then connected to an Arduino microcontroller (see <a class="xref" href="ch09.html#pacman_0202" title="Figure 9-2. Arduino code controls voltage of the electrodes based on input of the joystick">Figure 9-2</a>).  The Arduino, in turn, was connected to the electrodes bounding the paramecia stage, controlling them based upon the input of the joystick.  Above all of this, on a platform constructed of equal parts wood and rubber bands, hovered the iPhone, with its camera augmented by an affordable microscope attachment and trained upon the paramecia stage.  As the paramecia moved, my code employed a careful combination of graphical filters to track their motion, and based upon this data generated a game similar to Pac-Man, in which the microorganisms collected Tron-like discs.  There was still a kink or two to work out, such as the contacts between the Arduino and the paramecia stage becoming loose and impairing joystick control, but it was nothing we couldn’t smooth out, we thought, during setup at Innovation Square after a good night’s rest.</p>

<div class="figure-title">Figure 9-2. Arduino code controls voltage of the electrodes based on input of the joystick</div>
</div></div>
<p id="oliver_has_desc">Oliver has described what followed as performing a magic trick for the first time live and hoping you don’t saw an audience member in half, which I find both hilarious and entirely accurate.  In addition to our little joystick problem being not so little (thanks in part to the throng of grasping children’s hands), the elements at the outdoor festival had conspired against us—the June heat was causing the iPhone to overheat as well as threatening to evaporate the liquid in which the paramecia were swimming, forcing Oliver and Sarah to perform continual water bottle and ice pack triage.  Additionally, strong gusts of wind were causing noise in the motion detection, requiring me to tweak the code constantly in real time to keep things running smoothly.  All this combined with fielding hundreds of questions, as well as managing dozens of paramecia-controlling gamers, makes for one hectic day.  In the end, however, it all came together.  Adults and children alike were fascinated by the concept of playing with microorganisms, and many even suggested that we launch a Kickstarter so they could buy such a system for home use.  They praised the retro-graphical style and chiptune music created for the game and gave us myriad suggestions for improvements such as a central electrode to gather paramecia together—illustrating how even children can contribute to fields such as biotechnology if given the chance.  In short, the response was incredible; <a class="ulink" href="http://bit.ly/1joag07" target="_top">our magic trick had worked</a>.</p>
<p id="emboldened_by_t">Emboldened by the successful proof of concept, we have continued to work on our prototype.  By the time we presented at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.nycresistor.com" target="_top">NYC Resistor’s</a> 2013 Interactive Show, for instance, we had laser-cut a clear acrylic housing, solving the wind problem while still allowing viewers to glimpse the system’s internal workings (see <a class="xref" href="ch09.html#games_fig3" title="Figure 9-3. Arduino, paramecia stage, and heat sink within clear acrylic housing">Figure 9-3</a>).  The knowledgeable hosts and audience members at this event even helped us solve our heat problem on the spot with an appropriately sized heat sink, giving just one example of the utility of atelier-style hacker spaces such as Resistor and of the Maker movement in general.  At the most recent event we attended, <a class="ulink" href="http://makerfaire.com/new-york-2013/" target="_top">Maker Faire 2013</a>, we showcased the addition of an arcade-style tilt feature, which prevents an accidental (or intentional) bump of the device from skewing the game in the player’s favor.  What has remained constant throughout every venue, however, is the overwhelming interest and enthusiasm people have expressed regarding this technology.  This paves the way for our team and others to move forward with new and interesting applications—massively multiplayer online games in which people communicate with one another via other living creatures, self-reflexive systems in which organisms control themselves in ways they never have before, generative musical applications in which the composers are single cells…</p>

<div class="figure-title">Figure 9-3. Arduino, paramecia stage, and heat sink within clear acrylic housing</div>
</div>
<p id="it_is_not_just_">It is not just in the realm of entertainment that this technology has application, but also in provoking thoughtful dialogue regarding ethics, free will, and what it means to be human among the various forms of life that inhabit our world.  This was clearly driven home to me when I was asked by a young girl if it hurt to control the paramecia, and if their movement was choice or compulsion.  To her first question, I was happy to answer no, as paramecia do not have nervous systems, but as for her second: that answer is not so simple.  Would not the traffic flows of human beings to a city in the morning and away from it in the evening look like a compulsion, too, from a suitable distance?  Even if a paremecium’s galvanotaxi   s nothing but a consequence of ion channels reacting to voltage gradients, is this really that different, in terms of free will, than electrical impulses traveling throughout a brain?</p>
<p id="it_is_my_hope_t">It is my hope that our game and others like it will go beyond even these questions and invite people to consider a future where we find a way to cooperate with organisms of every scale.  Such an approach, characterized by partnership with—rather than subjugation and destruction of—nature has the potential to foster the sustainable future all of us want and can achieve.</p>

<p id="this_year_for_h">This year for Halloween, we decellularized a pig heart. We got a nice bleeding heart, hooked it up to some plumbing, stripped out all its cells with enzymes and detergents, and then bottled the thing in Everclear. Because every mad scientist’s den deserves to have some mad science on display.</p>

<div class="figure-title">Figure 10-1. Ghost heart in a jar</div>
</div>
<p id="for_those_of_yo">For those of you interested in trying this yourself, we’ve posted a detailed <a class="ulink" href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Ghost-Heart-in-a-Jar/" target="_top">Instructable</a>. Don’t be put off by the complexity of the procedure—when it comes down to it, the hardest part of this project is the plumbing. Actually, this would be a great project for a parent to do with a kid who’s really into bioscience and wants to go a little farther than the dissections in AP biology at school.</p>
<p id="so_why_would_yo">So why would you want to decellularize a heart? This is a technique being developed that may eventually produce <a class="ulink" href="http://bit.ly/1joakgw" target="_top">organs for transplantation, composed of a patient’s own cells</a>. The idea is to take a donor organ and strip it of all its cells, leaving nothing but the extracellular matrix that held the cells in place. This scaffold of connective tissue—called a "ghost organ" for its pale and almost translucent appearance—can then be reseeded with a <span class="keep-together">patient's</span> own cells, with the goal of regenerating an organ that can be transplanted into the patient without fear of tissue rejection.</p>
<p id="amazingly_mous">Amazingly, mouse and rat ghost hearts reseeded with cardiac precursor cells will actually start beating autonomously (great videos <a class="ulink" href="http://bit.ly/KI5Ge8" target="_top">here</a> and <a class="ulink" href="http://bit.ly/LVkasC" target="_top">here</a>). Some of those techniques seem daunting, but the <a class="ulink" href="http://www.pellinglab.net/tag/decellularization/" target="_top">Pelling Lab</a> at the University of Ottawa has already illustrated how easy and eminently DIY-able the decellularization process is; in the case of a <a class="ulink" href="http://www.pellinglab.net/decellularization/" target="_top">mouse heart</a> or even of a <a class="ulink" href="http://www.pellinglab.net/was-steak/" target="_top">whole steak</a>, it could be as simple as soaking in detergent for a while.</p>
<p id="having_spent_a_">Having spent a good amount of time thinking about related tissue engineering techniques for the BioPrinting community project at BioCurious, it seemed only natural to try our hand at decellularization as a Halloween project. So last year, half a dozen strong-stomached biohackers got an assortment of chicken hearts and gizzards from the grocery store and made an impromptu run at decellularization.Every participant got a chicken heart to play with and tried a unique combination of detergent choice, number of distilled water and saline rinses, etc. In the end, we wound up with <a class="ulink" href="http://www.meetup.com/BioCurious/photos/11068182/" target="_top">several jars of chicken heart in detergent soup</a> on the shake platform. Shaking, and shaking, and shaking, for days on end with very little effect. Sure, we had a few hearts that were getting noticeably paler, but the whole mess was definitely getting noticeably stinkier as well! Lessons learned. We decided to table the experiment for the year and try again for Halloween 2013. Next time, we plotted, we would use a (more human-like) pig heart, and perfuse detergents through the organ, to make sure all the cells in the tissue are broken up and flushed out equally.</p>
<p id="fast_forward_on">Fast forward one year: Cameron at BioCurious managed to get us some pig hearts from his sister’s farm, so we planned to do a test run at <a class="ulink" href="http://sf.sciencehackday.com/" target="_top">Science Hack Day San Francisco</a>. Unfortunately, hearts that have been butchered for food typically have the arteries at the top of the heart cut off and a slash through the chambers of the heart to let the blood drain out, which makes them entirely unsuited for our perfusion experiment. Instead, we cut some slices from the heart and <a class="ulink" href="http://bit.ly/1kYZwan" target="_top">tested a range of digestive enzymes on them</a>.</p>
<p id="what_we_needed_">What we needed was a pig heart butchered specifically for biological experiments (called a "bioheart" in the trade). So we got ourselves some bloody pig bio-hearts from a local meat wholesaler, ordered some simple reagents, located a pump (thanks, Eric!), got some plumbing supplies from Home Depot, assembled a motley crew of coconspirators from <a class="ulink" href="http://www.counterculturelabs.org/" target="_top">Counter Culture Labs</a> and BioCurious, and decided to try again. With mere days before Halloween, we descended on BioCurious for a full-day experiment.</p>

<div class="figure-title">Figure 10-2. Some assembly required: pig heart with hose clamp and barbed coupler attached to the aorta, ready for retrograde coronary perfusion</div>
</div>
<p id="the_published_p">The published protocols take 10–13 hours to complete, but since it took us hours to get everything setup correctly, we ended up adjusting the durations on the fly to fit into the time remaining. And since we were just making a showpiece rather than a ghost heart that could be successfully reseeded with stem cells, we made some judicious substitutions in the reagents: using plain tap water instead of gallons and gallons of reagent-grade water, kitchen salt in tap water instead of phosphate buffered saline, OxyClean (sodium percarbonate) instead of peracetic acid, and 151-proof Everclear instead of reagent-grade ethanol. If you wanted to do a real hardcore DIY version, you should even be able to replace the initial trypsin perfusion with digestive enzymes from the health food store (bromelain seemed to work quite well) and replace the lab-grade detergent with a concentrated shampoo! We didn’t have access to a high-volume peristaltic pump, but a buffer recirculation pump seemed to work OK. Again, you could completely DIY this part by using a fountain pump from the hardware store, or even just an elevated bucket (six-foot elevation should give you about the right fluid pressure).</p>

<div class="figure-title">Figure 10-3. Residual blood leaking out of the heart during the initial perfusion steps, as we push fluids through the heart muscle</div>
</div>
<p id="one_nice_aspect">One nice aspect about this experiment is that it uses fairly mild reagents, since the end result should be able to support cellular growth. But you’re also working with lots of fluids under pressure, and you really, really don’t want assorted pig heart juices squirting into your eyes. So make sure to wear some goggles at least. Also, if you’re using a fountain pump, keep in mind that they’re typically immersion pumps and not designed to handle conductive saline solutions. So try at your own risk…</p>
<p id="this_was_probab">This was probably one of the most ambitious single-day experiments we have been involved in—especially since none of us had any experience in doing this kind of thing. We frankly surprised ourselves with how well it worked (including some successful emergency cardiac surgery using super glue!), and we ended up with a stunning showpiece. Although initially daunting, the techniques are well within reach of the DIY community and can be used to educate and begin discussions on the latest in organ engineering research.</p>

</div></div>
<p id="one_of_the_goal">One of the goals of the Glowing Plant project was to inspire others to look at crowdfunding as a way to reach their own goals within DIYbio/synthetic biology. We’ve been pleased to see a number of bioengineering campaigns launch; however, they have been unable to raise similar amounts of funding.  Therefore, we want to share our tips and tricks in hopes that they will be useful to others embarking on a crowdsourced funding journey.</p>
<div class="sect1" data-original-filename="Second-Issue_-How-we-crowdfunded-$484k-to-make-Glowing-Plants.asciidoc" id="_preparation">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title">Preparation</h2></div></div></div>
<p id="once_a_crowdfun">Once a crowdfunding campaign gets underway, you will become overwhelmed and insanely busy. Also, crowdfunding campaigns have a significant momentum effect, so it’s important that they are as well presented and developed as possible at launch.  Planning for the campaign is critical.</p>
<p id="we_started_form">We started formal planning eight months before the launch date.  The most important thing at this early stage was discussing our plans to engineer a glowing plant with everyone we knew and met in person, including at meetups and other events.</p>
<p id="sharing_the_pro">Sharing the project openly and transparently up front achieved three goals:</p>
<div class="orderedlist" id="we_wanted_to_kn_id1"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1">
<li class="listitem">
We wanted to know if people were excited by and wanted to talk about the project. From our discussions, we learned our supporters wanted the engineered seeds.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
It established a personal relationship with people, so when they saw the project, they felt a personal connection to it.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
It allowed us to build partnerships broadening our social network, as the reach of the campaign is proportional to the size of the network. Many of these partners also became part of the project and helped in other ways.
</li>
</ol></div>
<p id="we_also_did_res">We also did research online, looking at other campaigns (backing a few we liked) and seeing what did and didn’t work. Both <a class="ulink" href="http://www.kickstarter.com/help/school" target="_top">Kickstarter</a> and <a class="ulink" href="http://www.indiegogo.com/crowdfunding-tips" target="_top">Indiegogo</a> publish information helping project creators plan their projects, and we took note of what they deemed important as well as <a class="ulink" href="http://bit.ly/1aJOxe9" target="_top">what other people online thought</a>.</p>
<p id="as_part_of_this">As part of this research, we learned that 80% of projects that get to 20% of their funding succeed, so this became our first target milestone. We realized that getting to 20% would be easier if we closed a few big backers early on, so we went on the road and sold those rewards in person, sometimes giving them additional perks as part of the package. One of these was a $10k backer, Cambrian Genomics, which supported the project within the first hour. This gave us instant credibility that we could reach the target, igniting a wave of optimism online.</p>
<p id="another_tip_we_">Another tip we got was from the founder of <a class="ulink" href="http://kck.st/1c4noDV" target="_top">Pebble</a>, who gave a talk at Singularity University. He convinced us to look at the landing page and treat it like a product in itself. You don’t launch a product without getting user input (I’ve made that mistake before!). We showed the preview page to over 100 people in the month prior to launch. These people included our advisors, roommates, friendly mailing lists, and even a few people I stopped on the street in San Francisco.</p>
<p id="the_feedback_we">The feedback we got from this group (e.g., your rewards are too expensive, the landing page is too complicated, and the video could be more exciting) was incredibly valuable. This was an iterative process; as we made the changes, we sought more opinions.</p>
<p id="we_also_receive">We also received landing page feedback from the Kickstarter product design category manager. We got criticism from scientists about this after launch, but it was the right decision. The landing page should be simple and most importantly actionable (back the project today!). That’s why we stripped away all the text and just used images on the page. Remember, most backers don’t understand the details and trust you to know them yourselves. Another reason for not going deep into technical details is that people will start discussing on social media platforms how you are going to do the science, which drives traffic and maybe some new ideas you hadn’t considered.</p>
<p id="clarity_around_">Clarity around regulation is incredibly important, because backers want product, and they want to know what you need to do to get it to them, as well as the project-execution risks. You have to reach out to the relevant regulatory agencies (USDA, EPA, or FDA) before launching the campaign. We found all of these agencies keen to engage early and approachable and frank in their opinions, especially if you get a personal introduction.</p>
<p id="one_campaign_we">One campaign we studied intensely was <a class="ulink" href="http://kck.st/KHLLwC" target="_top">"The Ten Year Hoodie."</a> We were amazed at how much money they raised for such a simple product. We were really inspired by the story arc and energy of their video. What really struck us, though, was how the campaign was about more than just the hoodie: it was about inspiring a whole new movement in manufacturing to improve quality and be based in the US. Our campaign goal was to inspire people about synthetic biology, so we made that a core feature of the video. Backers support a project and take a risk because the campaign is about more than just a product.</p>
<p id="a_good_video_is">A good video is critical. Kickstarter says you can make it yourself, but we suck at videography, so we decided to outsource it, which turned out to be a great decision. (If you’re looking for one, talk to <a class="ulink" href="http://www.ricksymonds.com/contact" target="_top">Rick Symonds</a>.) Doing this properly takes capital (in the range of thousands of dollars), but it also signals to backers that you are serious about the project if you have put your own money at risk before launch. Good music is important, and I spent two days reviewing clips on <a class="ulink" href="https://www.audiosocket.com/" target="_top">Audio Socket</a> and <a class="ulink" href="http://www.themusicbed.com" target="_top">The Music Bed</a>. Shoot the video, get feedback on the draft, then reshoot and repeat.</p>
<p id="setting_the_tar">Setting the target goal is hard—you want a low goal that looks attainable (and that you can get to the magic 20%), but not so low a goal that executing will be impossible. Momentum matters, and people like to back a winner, so the lower the goal you set, the better—most projects that reach their goal go significantly over it. We set our goal at the minimum amount necessary to still actually want to do the project. This approach means you can do an all-or-nothing campaign, as raising less than our goal would make it a struggle to execute.</p>

<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title">Running the Campaign</h2></div></div></div>
<p id="we_split_the_ca">We split the campaign into three phases:</p>
<div class="orderedlist" id="getting_to___id1"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1">
<li class="listitem">
Getting to 20% of our target funding goal by reaching our friends and family, who all knew the campaign was coming in advance and had promised to back within the first few days.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Getting to the goal of $65k by reaching out to the tech community/early <span class="keep-together">adopters.</span>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Going beyond that goal by reaching out to the mainstream/national press and to the broader public. (This phase was not well planned in advance, and what we did plan, for example, gardeners as our target segment, mostly failed.)
</li>
</ol></div>
<p id="within_each_gro">Within each group, we wanted to create a <span class="emphasis"><em>surround sound</em></span> effect so that people in that segment saw the project three to four times in a week and hopefully decided to back it.</p>
<p id="we_launched_at_">We launched at 9:30 a.m. Pacific time on a Tuesday; we selected this time because it gave us nearly the whole week to generate press and wasn’t Monday morning, when people are just getting into their work week. The 20% target all knew the campaign was coming and what time it was expected to launch. We had  emails ready to go to them and some friendly mailing lists (e.g., DIYbio and BioCurious) the second we went live. Around 20 people were anticipating the launch and ready to start sending messages to other people and share on social media.</p>
<p id="we_then_posted_">We then posted to HackerNews, which didn’t yield too many donations. However, it did result in people posting our campaign on other social news sites like reddit and Slashdot, resulting in some significant traffic over several days. Reddit was especially powerful—it brought more donations than the <span class="emphasis"><em>New York Times</em></span> article!</p>
<p id="because_i_live_">Because I live in the Bay Area, I know someone at Techcrunch, which helped us get one of the journalists to cover the Glowing Plant story. We offered her an exclusive in exchange for Techcrunch holding off on publishing until after we launched the campaign, and that article led to many more (like <span class="emphasis"><em>Gizmag</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Fast Company</em></span>, <a class="ulink" href="http://bit.ly/LVl5t3" target="_top"><span class="emphasis"><em>inhabitat</em></span></a>). We learned that all the leading blogs are read by other blogs who will want to write follow-up articles once you become a news story (this was also true with mainstream press, who all got in touch after the <span class="emphasis"><em>New York Times</em></span> article). Thus the first story is the hardest to get, so network!</p>
<p id="after_that_it_">After that, it was mostly momentum and being prompt and responsive to incoming interest. Journalists are busy, and if they reached out, the least we could do was reply as soon as possible to schedule a time to talk. I worked 16 hours a day dealing with the onslaught, and we had two interns helping answer messages (we got hundreds per day). You can’t run a campaign like ours part time or in addition to other activities.</p>
<p id="one_trick_we_le">One trick we learned was syndication. Obvious examples of this are tweets or Facebook shares of articles, but some news agencies also push articles out to other sites in syndication deals. For Singularity Hub, this led to five times the traffic from the original article, so it’s always worth asking journalists to syndicate you.</p>
<p id="another_thing_w">Another thing we learned was the value of controversy, so don’t be afraid of it. We had NGO’s who didn’t like our project pitch to mainstream news agencies for us, resulting in press like the <span class="emphasis"><em>New York Times</em></span> piece, which we could never have gotten ourselves. You are not building consensus with your campaign—you are firing up your core supporters, your core believers, so much that they want to give you money even though you don’t have a product yet. You want discussion and debate—that’s what drives passion, and that’s what drives social media. People share your project when they care, and controversy makes them care. Anything in synthetic bio will be controversial, so don’t be afraid of that, but just remember to stick within clear ethical and lawful lines and develop a thick skin; on the Internet, haters are just going to hate, so accept it.</p>
<p id="in_the_last_day">In the last days of the campaign, we used Hootsuite to schedule hourly tweets and Facebook messages counting down until the end. It’s hard to track whether these worked, but they created urgency at the end to go along with the Kickstarter reminder email.</p>

<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title">What Didn’t Work</h2></div></div></div>
<p id="lots_of_things_">Lots of things went well with our campaign, but there were a few that didn’t:</p>
<div class="variablelist" id="stretch_goals_w"><dl class="variablelist">
<dt><span class="term">
Stretch goals
</span></dt>
<dd>
We hoped for success, but we didn’t plan well enough for it with our stretch goals. I wish we had made them more frequent milestones and things that benefited all backers.  Every project is different, but we should have outlined which additional experiments we could do with additional funds and linked those experiments to the stretch goals explaining how they would make the plant brighter. Still, I’m very excited about the glowing rose!
</dd>
<dt><span class="term">
Duration
</span></dt>
<dd>
Kickstarter recommends 30 days; we didn’t listen and did 45 days. Most campaigns are a U-shaped (see <a class="ulink" href="http://bit.ly/1mtLcSA" target="_top">our Kicktraq data</a>), with a huge peak at the start, then a long lull, then another rush at the end after Kickstarter sends the reminder email. If you extend the campaign, all you do is extend the lull, which means more stress until you get the funds.
</dd>
<dt><span class="term">
Facebook ads
</span></dt>
<dd>
We tried running Facebook ads to drive traffic in the lull, but they brought in less money than we spent on them. However, I wish we could have targeted people who liked the page as well as their friends.
</dd>
<dt><span class="term">
PR agency
</span></dt>
<dd>
We had a good conversion rate (2–8%, depending on source) and figured more traffic would lead to more conversions, so we hired a PR agency that contacted us. They got a few articles, but nothing compared to what we did ourselves. Journalists want to talk directly to the founders—you don’t need a middleman.
</dd>
</dl></div>

<div class="sect1" data-original-filename="Second-Issue_-How-we-crowdfunded-$484k-to-make-Glowing-Plants.asciidoc" id="_post_campaign">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title">Post-Campaign</h2></div></div></div>
<p id="we_vaguely_thou">We vaguely thought we’d plan the post-campaign during the actual campaign, which was a big mistake, as we didn’t have time. The campaign is just crazy—we should have developed the strategy for that before launching. The most important thing is to plan where to direct traffic after the campaign ends because Kickstarter locks the page the second you finish. You have to set up those links ahead of time.  If you will continue taking preorders, you want to decide that up front so that it can all be setup in advance. <a class="ulink" href="http://trycelery.com" target="_top">http://trycelery.com</a> and <a class="ulink" href="http://shopstarter.com" target="_top">http://shopstarter.com</a> seem to be the leading platforms to help with that.</p>
<p id="you_also_want_t">You also want to think about search engine optimization (SEO) post-campaign. We were encouraged to give a redirect link out to journalists (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.glowingplant.com/kickstarter" target="_top">http://www.glowingplant.com/kickstarter</a>) for the page rather than the actual page. That way, you can change it later and keep the SEO juice for yourself.</p>
<p id="another_thing_t">Another thing to plan for are credit card defaults (which is less of a problem on Indiegogo, which collects money upfront). These defaults come mostly from expired credit cards, and you can expect to spend the first week after the campaign chasing these people down to get new card details, so don’t go on holiday too fast! After about one week, the campaign funding gets locked, and a week or so later, you get the funds. Our net proceeds were $432k, so about 89% of the total (the remainder is comprised of defaults, Amazon fees, and Kickstarter fees). Don’t forget to budget this 11% cost in your planning!</p>

<p id="the_campaign_wa">The campaign was one of the most rewarding events in my career. It was an intense but incredible feeling to see the numbers go up and knowing people were putting their faith in us. We take the trust and responsibilities of the backers very seriously, and the plants are already glowing. We can’t wait to ship them to everyone next summer!</p>
<p id="we_benefited_fr">We benefited from so many people’s advice before launch, and we want to pay that forward to others. If you are planning a similar campaign, please do get in touch—we want to help! Just make sure to give us at least a couple weeks before your launch date to get back to you.</p>

<div><h1 class="title">Chapter 12. Cheese, Art, and Synthetic Biology</h1></div>
<div><h3 class="subtitle"><em>An Interview with Christina Agapakis</em></h3></div>
<div><div class="author"><h3 class="author"><span class="othername">Katherine Liu</span></h3></div></div>
</div></div>
<p id="katherine_liu_" class="interview"><span class="strong"><strong><span class="emphasis"><em>Katherine Liu</em></span>: What can art and design teach us about biology and synthetic biology?</strong></span></p>
<p id="christina_agapa" class="interview"><span class="emphasis"><em>Christina Agapakis</em></span>: That’s a great question. There are two different ways you can think about it: first as a way to reach different groups of people and have a different kind of conversation or debate around biotechnology. The second way that you could think about it is more interesting to me as a scientist, because I think using art and design helps us ask different questions and think about problems and technological solutions in different ways. To make a good technology, we need to be aware of both the biological and the cultural issues involved, and I think the intersection of art and design with science and technology helps us see those connections better.</p>
<p id="kl_what_kinds__id1" class="interview"><span class="emphasis"><em>KL</em></span>: What kinds of projects have you done by combining art and biology?</p>
<p id="ca_im_really_" class="interview"><span class="emphasis"><em>CA</em></span>: I’m really interested in bacteria and bacterial communities and how bacteria show us a different part of the world that we don’t normally see. So a lot of the work I’ve been doing with art hasn’t necessarily been about synthetic biology directly, but instead about how we interact with bacteria on our bodies and in our environment and how these relationships might change in the future as synthetic biology develops. So for example, although it came out of <a class="ulink" href="http://syntheticaesthetics.org" target="_top">Synthetic Aesthetics</a>, which was about connecting synthetic biology with art and design, <a class="ulink" href="http://agapakis.com/selfmade.html" target="_top">the cheese project</a> isn’t really about the potential for genetic engineering to create synthetic biology technologies. Instead, we used cheese as a model for thinking about a much more basic form of biotechnology, how we can shape communities of bacteria to create these really fantastic and delicious products, and how our bodies and our food are these really fascinating ecosystems.
Other projects I’ve been working on recently have been around more environmental issues. I’ve been <a class="ulink" href="http://agapakis.com/encounters.html" target="_top">isolating microbes from polluted water</a> and <a class="ulink" href="http://agapakis.com/dirt.html" target="_top">from soils</a> around California, using bacteria to understand how humans interact with the environment.</p>
<p id="kl_how_did_you" class="interview"><span class="strong"><strong><span class="emphasis"><em>KL</em></span>: How did you first get involved with biotechnology?</strong></span></p>
<p id="ca_i_was_reall" class="interview"><span class="emphasis"><em>CA</em></span>: I was really excited about biology in high school and then kind of obsessed with everything I learned about molecular biology and biochemistry in college. When I started working in a lab, I learned that a lot of basic biology experiments involve genetic engineering. To understand how genes work, people are moving genes around and understanding how things fit together, and I was excited to be learning those techniques and tools. But it wasn’t until graduate school when I first met my advisor, Pam Silver, that I heard about synthetic biology. She’s one of the leaders in the field, and she really inspired me to think about the things I had learned in my biology classes and in the lab not just as a way to learn more about how cells work, but also as a way to do engineering and to build useful things. That was really exciting for me, and Pam is great. So that’s how I got into the field of synthetic biology!</p>
<p id="kl_what_kind_o" class="interview"><span class="strong"><strong><span class="emphasis"><em>KL</em></span>: What kind of trends do you see coming up in biotechnology?</strong></span></p>
<p id="ca_i_think_the" class="interview"><span class="emphasis"><em>CA</em></span>: I think the field is definitely maturing in some really interesting ways. In academia, we’re seeing a lot more complexity in the kinds of projects people are working on. A lot of the projects that have been talked about for a while but have been a lot of really hard work to build are starting to come online, in particular projects like the Church lab’s reprogrammed E. coli genome. I’m also really excited by what I see happening in terms of synthetic ecologies. You see more people working with communication between bacteria and engineering communities of bacteria to do things.</p>
<p id="kl_what_do_you" class="interview"><span class="strong"><strong><span class="emphasis"><em>KL</em></span>: What do you think the future of synthetic biology is going to look like?</strong></span></p>
<p id="ca_for_me_i_w" class="interview"><span class="emphasis"><em>CA</em></span>: For me, I want to see it become more like biology—more messy, more like cheese making than like computer science. The analogies between computers and cells have been really interesting and have gotten people really excited about synthetic biology’s potential, but I think what we’re going to see is a transformation: a new paradigm as we learn how complicated things are inside a cell and where those analogies break down. We’re going to be able to develop new ideas based around the ways that biology does things that are going to be more complex and more robust and able to adapt in interesting ways, and I think that’s going to shift the way that we think about biotechnology.</p>
<p id="kl_i_noticed_t" class="interview"><span class="strong"><strong><span class="emphasis"><em>KL</em></span>: I noticed that you’ve been an iGEM advisor. How can we bring biotechnology to younger students?</strong></span></p>
<p id="ca_i_think_ige" class="interview"><span class="emphasis"><em>CA</em></span>: I think iGEM in particular has been really excited about getting college-level and now high school students to think about biology as an engineering platform. In high school, I was on the robotics team, and there were a lot of engineering competitions. But that hasn’t really been there for biology yet, so iGEM is creating that same sort of idea of team-based projects around biology instead of around robots. It’s been really great, and advising teams has been really fun for me and really rewarding. I was an advisor for the Harvard team for a couple of years, and I’ve been working with students at UCLA—this is the first year UCLA competed in iGEM. There were a couple of students who were really excited about starting a team and developing a project, and it was really fun and hard work to help them get this started. But it’s been great to see students learn by doing and learn about what is possible with those tools by jumping into the lab.</p>
<p id="kl_what_kinds__id2" class="interview"><span class="strong"><strong><span class="emphasis"><em>KL</em></span>: What kinds of projects did the UCLA iGEM team work on?</strong></span></p>
<p id="ca_this_year_" class="interview"><span class="emphasis"><em>CA</em></span>: This year, <a class="ulink" href="http://2013.igem.org/Team:UCLA" target="_top">the UCLA team</a> was interested in phage, which are viruses that can kill bacteria, and they’re interested in that relationship and the specificity between phage and bacteria. They found a really cool system where one phage uses recombination to generate a lot of diversity in the way that it interacts with the bacteria, so there’s this natural system that the phage uses to accelerate evolution so it can interact with different things on the surface of the bacteria. They use that protein as a scaffold to do protein engineering, so they were looking at natural systems that created a lot of diversity and using those as a scaffold to generate diversity in vitro, in the lab to apply it to other cells.</p>
<p id="kl_i_think_an_" class="interview"><span class="strong"><strong><span class="emphasis"><em>KL</em></span>: I think an issue that a lot of students who go into biology face is whether to go into academia or industry right out of school. Why did you choose academia?</strong></span></p>
<p id="ca_i_wanted_to" class="interview"><span class="emphasis"><em>CA</em></span>: I wanted to learn forever—I was really excited about going to graduate school. I didn’t know a lot about biotechnology and I’d never heard of synthetic biology; I was just excited about biology and chemistry and how things worked. I wanted to figure out how those things worked, so that’s why I went into grad school right out of college. Now we see more and more that there’s an overlap between the applied technology-building side of industry and the knowledge-building side of academia. There’s a really interesting connection between making and knowing. In synthetic biology, that’s really clear—as we make things, we understand more about them, and there’s some really interesting crossovers happening between industry and academia, too.</p>
<p id="kl_do_you_have" class="interview"><span class="strong"><strong><span class="emphasis"><em>KL</em></span>: Do you have any advice for students who really want to study what you do, especially areas combining biology and art?</strong></span></p>
<p id="ca_the_advice_" class="interview"><span class="emphasis"><em>CA</em></span>: The advice that I give to students is always just to follow what you’re curious about, and read a lot. What I see a lot is students who are really curious and passionate about certain fields, but they actively stop themselves from learning more about it, from following this curiosity, because they think that it might not be useful or that it doesn’t fit with the idea of what a good student or a good scientist would be interested in. I was an instructor for an art and science <a class="ulink" href="http://summer.artscicenter.com/" target="_top">summer program at UCLA for high school students</a>, and many of the students came in with an idea of what counted as science and what counted as art, and what they were good at or not good at. They would say, “I’m good at physics, and I only want to do physics,” (or even worse, “I’m not good at math, I don’t want to math and science"). But through the two weeks we were doing the program, they began to see the connections between what they were really excited about in physics or in art and other things, maybe in other fields of science or in fields of art and the humanities. So my advice is: don’t be limited by what you think you’re good at or what you’re supposed to be good at, because some of the most interesting things you can learn come from the connections that you can make from looking a little bit outside of the path that you’re on.</p>

</div></div>
<p id="where_do_we_go_">Where do we go to dream? It’s a question I asked myself as I heard the news about the FDA cracking down on 23andMe, a service that dared to dream outside of our regulatory system’s confines. As we travel down new and unexplored paths, where do we go to move away from the understandably conservative thinking of our industry and think about biotechnologies that will, as Astro Teller from Google X labs says, make a 10x improvement to our world? I grew up reading mind-expanding sci-fi from Asimov, Sagan, Bear, Heinlein, Egan, Stross, and many others, and yet I couldn’t find a list for those of us who wanted to dive deeper into the oddities and possible futures of the technology of life. So after a discussion with Kyle Taylor, the head scientist for Glowing Plants, in which we discussed one future possibility of engineering crops to grow on the surface of oceans to feed the hungry billions of the world, I thought it would be worth reaching out across the Web to compile a list of other future possible biotechnologies.</p>
<p id="hopefully_some_">Hopefully some of the books and short stories in this list will help inspire the next generation of biohackers, scientists, and DIY biologists.</p>
