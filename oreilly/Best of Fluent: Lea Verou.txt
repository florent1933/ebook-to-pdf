<p id="mac_slocum_"><span class="strong"><strong>Mac Slocum:</strong></span> [0:01] Why are regular expressions important?</p>
<p id="lea_verou_"><span class="strong"><strong>Lea Verou:</strong></span> [0:03] Regular expressions can greatly simplify lots of common code
sequences. In many cases, you can condense 100 lines of code into
single-line regular expressions.</p>
<p id="regular__id3">[0:14] Regular expressions is just a language that describes a set
of strings. Every time you need to test if a string matches a
certain pattern, for example, is something an email address? Or if
you want to extract part of a string, like extracting, for example,
all the words in a text. Or counting them, or validating data.</p>
<p id="regular__id4">[0:35] Regular expressions can greatly help in all of these cases,
and they’re usually much more performant than having 100 lines of
string manipulation functions.</p>
<p id="slocum___id1"><span class="strong"><strong>Slocum:</strong></span> [0:43] Is it one of those skills that falls through the cracks? One
of those things that it’s worth doubling back to make sure that
you’ve got that in your tool set?</p>
<p id="verou__i_id1"><span class="strong"><strong>Verou:</strong></span> [0:51] I think many developers don’t focus enough on regular
expressions, because they’re considered one of the least exciting
aspects of programming. They tend to get excited about new APIs,
cool stuff, new frameworks, and libraries. That’s something that’s
doesn’t have lots of…It’s not considered cool.</p>
<p id="slocum___id2"><span class="strong"><strong>Slocum:</strong></span> [1:12] Switching gears a little bit, moving over to CSS a bit, do
you think we’ll get to a point where we don’t have proprietary CSS
elements anymore, or is that just wishful thinking?</p>
<p id="verou__t_id1"><span class="strong"><strong>Verou:</strong></span> [1:24] That depends on how we treat the ones we have today. If we
keep developing for proprietary features of certain browsers, the
same way people develop for WebKit-only stuff today, then yes,
companies will still do it, because it helps them advance in the
browser market.</p>
<p id="that_bas">[1:41] That basically hurts web developers. Remember what happened
when we got a very cool browser, with many cool, shiny, proprietary
features? Web developers got really excited about that browser and
its proprietary features, they started using them, and then we got
locked in that browser, and we got a decade of IE6. IE6 was a great
browser when it was released.</p>
<p id="slocum___id3"><span class="strong"><strong>Slocum:</strong></span> [2:05] 10 years later, not so much. Last question for you. What is
your process for experimenting with a new feature? What’s the
criteria that it has to meet, for you?</p>
<p id="verou__i_id2"><span class="strong"><strong>Verou:</strong></span> [2:16] I guess the criteria is that I usually want the feature to
have at least one implementation. It’s really hard to experiment
with something that’s just a spec, and doesn’t have any
implementations. Quite often, there are specs that never get
implemented. There’s no interest from browsers, so they never
implement them, even though they exist for years.
For example, there used to be a spec that defined how we can have
multiple pseudo-elements. Multiple :before pseudo-elements
or :after pseudo-elements, or multiple ::outside pseudo-elements.
It was really exciting. Browsers didn’t care, they didn’t implement
it. We had to actually drop the features in that spec, because when
there is no interest the specs changes.</p>
<p id="slocum___id4"><span class="strong"><strong>Slocum:</strong></span> [3:03] Thanks so much for being with us. Appreciate you taking the
time.</p>
<p id="verou__t_id2"><span class="strong"><strong>Verou:</strong></span> [3:06] Thank you.</p>

<p id="hello_ev">[0:02] Hello everyone. It’s great to be here today. As you’ve probably noticed, my name is Lea Verou. If my name sounds vaguely familiar, it’s probably due to one of my open source tools. All of
them have something in common. They try to use as little of the
server as possible.</p>
<p id="everythi">[0:20] Everything that can be done on the client, is done on the
client. That’s often referred to as thin server architecture.
Basically the server is used to store files and data and keep both
of them safe. The client is used for pretty much everything else.</p>
<p id="dabblet_">[0:37] Dabblet is a prime example of this, and it’s what inspired
this presentation. It’s a social web application for testing and
sharing snippets of CSS. It uses way more client and way less
server than most people imagine. The biggest reason I’m a proponent
of this approach is its basically infinite scalability.</p>
<p id="every_line_of_c">Every line of code you write on the server might end up being
executed hundreds or even thousands of times if your application
becomes successful or even if you’re lucky enough to get
Slashdotted. Everything you write on the client
always deals with one machine. It might not be the best machine you
can imagine. It might be an old computer that’s kind of slow, but
it’s still probably better than a slice of your server.</p>
<p id="it_also_">[1:26] It also helps reduce server costs quite a lot, because
basically the server is just used to serve files. So server load
doesn’t increase, which is the prime reason of moving to a
dedicated server and then to more servers. Especially for me, since
most of them are side projects, my budget for them is quite
limited. I guess that’s a problem that many start-ups face as well.</p>
<p id="every_ti">[1:49] Every time I have this discussion with someone or a group of
people, some know-it-all always points out something like, "But
servers these days are cheap, right?" Not really. Bandwidth is
cheap. Storage is cheap. CPU cycles are very rarely cheap, and
database administrators and performance engineers and all these
people that help big companies that have tons of servers — these
are never cheap. You can’t usually afford these on a side project
or on a start-up.</p>
<p id="another__id1">[2:23] Another added benefit of this approach is that it helps a
much more responsive UI, a much more snappy user experience. Less
round trips to the server means less page reloads and less dreaded
loading spinners like the ones I have in the background to give you
nightmares.</p>
<p id="however_id1">[2:41] However, thin server architecture wasn’t enough. I wanted to
get rid of the data component on the server as well and move all
the things to the client. Is that even possible? My first naïve
thought was to use local storage or IndexedDB to store the data on
the client, which works well for some applications.</p>
<p id="for_exam">[3:04] For example in cubic-bezier.com it uses local storage to
store the curves in your library and you can import and export them
as JSON. If I worked a bit more on that, you could probably
download a JSON file, which would be easier. But still, using files
for sharing is so '90s.</p>
<p id="people_w">[3:25] People want to use URLs for sharing and that doesn’t really
help. Another thought was using URIs as storage. This is helpful in
cases where your data is tiny. For example, in css.coloratum.com,
the data is just css color. Or in cubic-bezier.com, the data you
usually want to share is not your entire library.</p>
<p id="its_jus">[3:47] It’s just a cubic Bezier curve, so you can use that in the
URL, and that kind of doubles as a feature as well, because you can
predict what the URL is going to be just by knowing your data. For
example, you want to share a color with someone and show them how
that color looks on their screen, you can figure out the URL
without even using the application.</p>
<p id="tweetplu">[4:08] TweetPlus is an application for posting long tweets. It’s
kind of like TweetLonger, but it’s entirely client-side. It has
basically no server-side component. The server is just used for
serving files. The way it works is by encoding the entire log suite
in the URL, which might sound unwieldy and counterintuitive. Who
wants to deal with huge URLs like this?</p>
<p id="it_makes">[4:32] It makes more sense if you realize that when you post a URL
on Twitter, it wraps it on its own URL shortener. Basically, the
entire, huge three-plus URL that might be up to 2,000 characters
becomes a small, 20-character t.co URL, which you can add in every
tweet, in any tweet you want.</p>
<p id="basicall">[4:55] Basically, it’s using Twitter to store your long tweet,
which creates a single point of failure. If Twitter goes down, you
lose your data, but you don’t depend on an external service. If
TweetLonger, at some point, decides that their business model is
not really good and they decide to close down, poof goes your long
tweets.</p>
<p id="i_think_">[5:16] I think to keep in mind when using this approach is A, if
history API’s available, use history API because setting the hash
might cause page jumps. Also, most importantly, don’t fire it too
frequently.</p>
<p id="good_can">[5:30] Good candidates for this are events like on Blur or an
unload, on mouseout. Bad candidates for this is events that fire
all the time, like on mousemove or on keyop or an input because
that means that if someone uses your application for five minutes,
you’ve completely littered the browser history. The browser history
basically consists now of points of states, intermediate states on
your application that they don’t really need to refer to.</p>
<p id="however_id2">[6:00] However, when I create a Dabblet, it was clear that that
approach was not going to be good, neither of these approaches. I
couldn’t use local storage or index DB and store the snippets on
the client because then people wouldn’t then be able to share them
easily. Obviously, I can use huge URLs that contain the entire CSS
and HTML code. I needed to come up with something else.</p>
<p id="at_some_">[6:25] At some point, I had a lightbulb moment. I decided to use
the GitHub gist API. I know you’re probably thinking, but come on,
JSONp is not really the best way to deal with this, so you need to
use the server as a proxy and that kind of defeats the purpose.</p>
<p id="actually">[6:44] Actually, these days, you can use third-party APIs from the
client directly with no server interaction by using a technology
called Cross-Origin Resource Sharing or CORS. This basically means
that for APIs that allow it, you can use XMLHTTPRequest normally,
just like you would otherwise.</p>
<p id="you_need">[7:06] You need to work around limitation 98 and 9. It doesn’t
support CORS in the standard form. It supports it in a different
object, X-Domain Request. That’s just a small difference. It
basically operates in exactly the same way.</p>
<p id="cors_is_support">CORS is supported by pretty much every browser. The main exception
is Opera, but it will support it in Opera 12. You can already test
it in the nightly builds.</p>
<p id="the_bigg">[7:33] The biggest caveat, of course, is that APIs need to allow it
explicitly by using an Access-Control-Allow-Origin header to define
with domains can access it. Some of them are more reluctant than
others.</p>
<p id="some_nic">[7:46] Some nice APIs that allow it are these. Many Google APIs,
GitHub API, which is great, especially for my case. Open Exchange
Rates is an API that allows you to get prices between different
currencies. Ziptastic allows you to get city and state information
from zip codes. GetFavicon allows you to get the Favicon and many
others.</p>
<p id="the_most">[8:08] The most notable exceptions are Twitter. Come on. I know
there are many of you here…</p>
<p id="laughter"><span class="emphasis"><em>[laughter]</em></span></p>
<p id="and_fli">[8:16] …and Flickr. There’s actually a feature request on Twitter
for a long time. They’re kind of not saying exactly now, but it’s
going to happen at some point. We don’t know when that point is
going to be. I’m really looking forward to that.</p>
<p id="its_act">[8:29] It’s actually up to you as well. If you request CORS support
from Twitter, they will have to support it eventually if lots of
you request it.</p>
<p id="i_dont_think_i">I don’t think I really need to explain the benefits that CORS has
over JSONP. It’s way more powerful. It basically allows you to do
all the range of different HTTP requests. JSONP is just a hack that
basically only allows GET requests. With CORS, you can do any kind
of request, POST request, PUT request. You can send different HTTP
headers, read HTTP headers. It has much better error handling, basically anything you can do with
XMLHTTPRequest.</p>
<p id="an_inter">[9:13] An interesting fact that I discovered when I launched
Dabblet was that what for me was something that I did to avoid
having a service side component that I had to pay for. People
actually loved that. They thought it was a feature. They thought I
did it because GitHub integration is something that people would
enjoy.</p>
<p id="it_turns">[9:36] It turns out that people trust third party APIs more than a
random newcomer application that needs to build user trust first,
because they know that if at some point I decide to take Dabblet
down they won’t lose their data. It will still be at GitHub and
they trust GitHub way more.</p>
<p id="another__id2">[9:55] Another benefit was that it’s very easy to add new features
because the back end is already there. For example, if I want to
add comments, I just need to utilize the API for comments. Even now
that the Dabblet interface doesn’t support comments yet, people can
just go to the gist and comment there. It gives them a bunch of
features that I didn’t even have to implement. Like they want to
use a Git repository unit, they can do it because every gist is
basically a small Git repository.</p>
<p id="some_of">[10:29] Some of you might think that this is leaching. But
actually, that’s what APIs are for. I’m not using it in any way
that’s against the terms or anything. It’s good for them. It’s good
for me. Win win.</p>
<p id="so_can_">[10:44] So can clients get too fat? Other cases where you should
use your server. A good example of this — and yes, they can get
too fat — is mobile. In mobile, the more JavaScript you have, the
more you drain the battery. If your application has lots of mobile
users, maybe you should consider doing more stuff on the server if
you can afford it.</p>
<p id="another_case_is">Another case is things that really need to be centralized. For
example, when Twitter launched their new interface, every time you
used a different client, you had to mark your direct messages as read again, because they, it seems that the
read state is stored on the client side. That’s not really, that’s
not good. It pisses off so many people.</p>
<p id="the_ans">[11:34] The answer is no, you shouldn’t necessarily client side all
the things. You should examine it on a case by case basis.</p>
<p id="thats__id1">[11:43] That’s about it. Thank you.</p>

<p id="hi_there">[0:04] Hi there, I’m Lea Verou. It’s great to be here today. You can see my Twitter username over there. If you have any questions and we don’t have time at the end, you can always ping me on
Twitter and ask me.</p>
<p id="regular__id1">[0:15] Regular expressions. Many people use many different names to
refer to regular expressions, such as regular expression, regexp,
regex. Some even use the term "monkey puke." Hopefully, by the end
of this presentation, if you’re one of them, you’ll have started to
change your mind a bit, so I’m going to ignore this for now.</p>
<p id="the_firs">[0:36] The first three names can be described in a much more
concise way. At least if we lived in a world where everybody was a
developer, we could refer to all three of them just with this line,
which is basically a regular expression itself, and that’s what
regular expressions are. They’re a way to describe a set of
strings.</p>
<p id="why_is_t">[0:55] Why is that useful? We can use them to check if a string
matches a certain format. We can use them in HTML5 for a form of
validation with the pattern attribute. We can use them to extract
certain parts out of strings or replace certain parts with
something else.</p>
<p id="we_can_u">[1:12] We can use them when we’re factoring it out at Text Editor
or IDE, or even in command line tools or databases and many more
tools. Luckily, the syntax used in most of these tools is pretty
much the same. JavaScript has some limitations compared to other
languages, but it’s pretty much consistent.</p>
<p id="to_start">[1:34] To start with the syntax, the very basic rules is that every
regular expression, literal, starts with a slash, ends with a
slash. What’s between the slashes is the pattern we’re trying to
match. After the slashes, there are the so-called flags, which in
JavaScript are just a combination of "g", "i", and "m", in no
particular order. While I’m explaining the syntax, you can go to
this web application I made for this talk, to test it for yourself,
if you want.</p>
<p id="there_ar_id1">[2:05] There are going to be some small challenges scattered
throughout the talk, to which you can participate through Twitter,
and whoever wins gets an O’Reilly "Regular Expressions" book.</p>
<p id="the_very">[2:18] The very basic regular expression is just a few letters or
symbols, which just match the exact string. This, for example,
matches "a" anywhere in the string. It doesn’t even need to start
or end with "a", it just matches anywhere. Unless, of course, you
restrict it, which we’ll see how you can do later.</p>
<p id="by_defau">[2:42] By default, it’s case-insensitive, so this won’t match
anything. But you can use the "i" flag to change this. That’s very
useful when testing, for example, if an element is of a particular
type, because the node name can have any kind of capitalization.</p>
<p id="if_your">[2:59] If you’re not very familiar with regular expressions, you’d
assume that this would match something like "1.5". Probably, you
can guess that it would match it anywhere in the string. But if
you’re not very familiar with them, you probably wouldn’t expect it
to match this, or this, or even this.</p>
<p id="the_dot_">[3:16] The dot matches pretty much any character, except line
breaks. You can change this behavior, if you just escape it with a
backslash. Now it only matches the dot. This is called a meta-
character, which means it’s a character that doesn’t only match
itself. It might not even match itself at all. It has a special
meaning.</p>
<p id="we_have_">[3:38] We have 12 total meta-characters, and if you want to use
them literally, in most cases you need to escape them. Not in every
case.</p>
<p id="regular__id2">[3:45] Regular expression engines are quite smart. In some cases,
they can figure it out on their own that you are just interested in
matching these characters literally. In this case, we have a
regular expression that matches four consecutive a’s, like this.</p>
<p id="but_what">[4:01] But what if we wanted to match 12 of them or 100 of them?
Would we have to keep typing, "aaaa" 100 times? We can use
something called a quantifier to specify this in a much more
concise way. This is exactly equivalent to the previous regular
expression, but it’s much shorter, especially if we wanted to match
more a’s.</p>
<p id="you_migh">[4:24] You might think that this is very strict. What if I don’t
want to match exactly 10 a’s? What if I want to match from 0 to 10,
or from 10 to 100? If you include a comma after the number, it
basically means at least that number. If you have four commas, it
means at least four. As you’ve noticed, the regular expression
engine matches as much as it can. That’s called greediness.</p>
<p id="if_you_g">[4:49] If you give the regular expression engine a choice, it will
match as many as it can. You can set an upper bound as well, like
from four to five, which only matches up to five a’s.</p>
<p id="there_ar_id2">[5:08] There are certain shortcuts as well. For example, if you
want to match any number of a’s from zero to whatever, it’s quite
interesting, in this case, to notice that you can actually match
the empty string. This regular expression matches the empty string.
We don’t have anything, but we want to match "a" from zero times to
whatever. Since we don’t have any a’s, it matches the a’s zero
times.</p>
<p id="due_to_g">[5:34] Due to greediness, if we have any a’s, it will match all of
them, as many as it can consume. We can use the shortcut to match
exactly this, from zero times to whatever. To infinity.</p>
<p id="if_we_wa_id1">[5:47] If we want the "a" to be present at least one time to avoid
matching the empty string, which is usually what we want. In most
cases, we don’t want to match the empty string, we can use a plus
sign instead, which means from one time to infinity.</p>
<p id="if_we_wa_id2">[6:03] If we want something that’s maybe present there but not
always, but not necessarily, we can use the question mark. This
matches from zero to one and due to greediness, it always matches,
in this case, one. If we don’t have any a’s, it matches the empty
string.</p>
<p id="like_her">[6:25] Like here. It doesn’t find any a’s, so it matches the empty
string. If you recall, in our original regular expression about how
we call regular expressions, we did something like this, which
means it matches both regex and regexp because the "p" is optional.</p>
<p id="greedine">[6:48] Greediness can be really annoying in some cases. For
example, assume you want to match HTML tags. You know that it’s
pretty simple, HTML… Most commonly, you wouldn’t want to use
regular expressions to match HTML, but in some cases, when you know
what to expect, you can do that.</p>
<p id="here_yo_id1">[7:07] Here, you want to match HTML strings to strip them out. For
example, from the comment, if you don’t want to allow HTML. You
think of writing a regular expression like this, angled bracket,
something whatever number of times, and then a closing angled
bracket.</p>
<p id="it_doesn">[7:22] It doesn’t match what you expect. You just wanted to match
this and the closing tag, but it doesn’t do that. It matches the
entire thing. Why? Because it matches the first angled bracket
here. Then it goes and matches as many things as it can. Here, it
finds this angled bracket.</p>
<p id="technica">[7:39] Technically, it’s correct. It’s not wrong, but it’s not what
you wanted. You can change this behavior and reverse greediness by
putting a question mark after the quantifier. Now, instead of
matching as many as it can, it matches as little as it can, the
fewer number of characters it can.</p>
<p id="now_it_">[8:00] Now, it does exactly what you want. It matches both the
start and the end string. You can even do things like this. If you
want something from zero to one time, you can have two question
marks, one after the other.</p>
<p id="in_case_">[8:17] In case you want to, say, to use alternation between certain
characters, you can use square brackets. This basically means any
character that’s either A or B or C, so this matches any of them
and doesn’t match D, for example. You can even use the plus sign to
say any number of these characters.</p>
<p id="if_you_w">[8:49] If you want to match multiple characters, like for example,
assuming you want to match a letter, according to this, you could
start doing this sort of thing and write the entire alphabet and
the character class.</p>
<p id="theres_">[9:02] There’s something better you can do. You can use ranges from
A to Z. Now, it matches every letter, ever letter you can think of.
It doesn’t match numbers or symbols, but it matches letters.</p>
<p id="you_can_">[9:20] You can even concatenate multiple of these ranges to produce
a union. If you want to match letters and numbers, you can do
something like this. You can even add single characters after them.
This matches both letters and numbers and the underscore, like
this.</p>
<p id="another__id3">[9:40] Another thing to note is that most metacharacters don’t need
escaping in square brackets. There are very few that do the correct
closing square bracket, because, otherwise, the regular special
engine won’t know when to stop, when the character class ends, but
most of them don’t really need escaping.</p>
<p id="also_w">[10:01] Also, we get some shortcuts here for very commonly needed
character classes. For example, \w means, basically, something
similar to the character class we did before, letters, numbers, and
the underscore. It’s basically equivalent to A to Z, both lower-
case and upper-case, 0 to 9, and the underscore. I can type any
letter, and it keeps matching it, numbers, underscores, or any
combination of them. One bad thing is that it’s not Unicode-aware,
so, if you want to match, for example, Greek letters, that won’t
work.</p>
<p id="theres_id1">[10:47] There’s also another character class that’s a bit more
restrictive than this. It only matches digits. It’s basically
equivalent to a character class from 0 to 9. This could match any
integer. It won’t match decimals.</p>
<p id="theres_id2">[11:06] There’s also a character class that matches whitespace, \s.
Any kind of whitespace. Tabs, line breaks, spaces. It’s actually
way more wide than what I’m showing there. That’s why I have, not
the equals sign, but the about equals, because it’s not exactly
equal to that character class.</p>
<p id="its_un">[11:31] It’s Unicode-aware, so it supports all the weird whitespace
characters that Unicode has. You can even combine those character
classes to form something more complex. For example, if you want to
match something that’s letters, digits, underscores, or hyphens,
you can do this, which combines the word character class and a
hyphen. Now it will even match it even if we have a hyphen there,
which is useful for matching things like telephone numbers.</p>
<p id="we_can_">[12:07] We can use this to count words in some text. These are two
different ways, each with their own advantage. For example, the
first one matches all the words and it counts how many words it
matched. The second one splits the text where it has whitespace and
counts how many words you have according to that.</p>
<p id="the_sec">[12:36] The second method is much better, because even though it
will match some things that might not be words, if you have a stray
dollar sign, for example, how common is that? The first one has a
much bigger bug. It won’t match any non-English word, because that
only matches English letters, not even accented English letters,
just plain, old ASCII English letters, and many text don’t only
have English words.</p>
<p id="this_is_id1">[13:07] This is one of the first of the challenges I mentioned at
the beginning of the talk. If you haven’t noted the URL with the
Web app, you can see it at the top of this slide. This is just a
test challenge. It won’t matter in the competition at all. It’s
just so that you can test the system, see how it works and
everything. You have a minute for that.</p>
<p id="the_twe">[13:33] The tweets you post are going to appear here, but don’t be
disappointed if your tweet doesn’t. It doesn’t mean that it won’t
be counted, because there’s a bit of a lag. It takes about 25
seconds for something to appear there. Basically, this counts
tweets with the regex plain hashtag. If you tweet directly from the
Web app, that will be added automatically.</p>
<p id="silence_id1"><span class="emphasis"><em>[silence]</em></span></p>
<p id="ok_i_g">[14:31] OK. I guess it works. This is the first of the challenges.
You should write a regular expression that matches a hex color.
These are some examples of the hex colors you need to match. They
might be upper-case, lower-case, 3-digit hex codes, or 6-digit hex
codes.</p>
<p id="silence_id2"><span class="emphasis"><em>[silence]</em></span></p>
<p id="by_the_">[15:02] By the way, if you’re interested in who won the book, I’ll
tweet about that after the talk. I can’t really decide on that
right this moment.</p>
<p id="silence_id3"><span class="emphasis"><em>[silence]</em></span></p>
<p id="whoa_">[16:03] Whoa, 11 tweets. Some of them got quite close. One first
thought might be something like this. The problem with this is not
that it doesn’t match some of the hex codes. The problem is that it
matches too many, and some of them are wrong. It will match hex
codes with four characters or five characters, which are invalid.
You need to only match hex codes with three or six characters.</p>
<p id="thats__id2">[16:24] That’s not exactly correct. That’s more like it. It matches
any letter from A to F or digit three times, and then this pattern
is repeated once or twice. By combining these quantifiers, you can
basically create some sort of quantifier that’s either three or six
times. It’s impossible to accidentally match hex codes with four
characters or five characters with this.</p>
<p id="charact">[17:03] Character classes can also be negated. In this case this
matches any letter from A to F, but this could also be written in
an alternative way, a letter from G to Z, and negate this. That’s
not exactly equivalent to the first one because that will also
match symbols, for example, there’s nothing that says it should
only match letters. This matches anything that’s not a letter
between G and Z.</p>
<p id="we_even">[17:37] We even have shortcuts for the negated character classes,
or for the negated versions of the character classes we mentioned
before. For example, the negated version of this could be written
more simply as this. That matches anything that’s not a letter, or
number, or underscore. See, for example, here it matches only the
percentage sign, or now it matches both of these symbols. It also
matches whitespace, pretty much anything that’s not a letter, or
number, or underscore.</p>
<p id="similar_id1">[18:11] Similarly, the negated version of the digit is the capital,
\D that matches anything except digits, so it will match every
character of the string except the digit, and the negated version
of whitespace that will match anything that’s not whitespace. An
interesting fact is that even the dot itself is a character class.
It’s basically this negated character class.</p>
<p id="what_do">[18:43] What does this mean? It means anything that’s not a line
break character, that’s exactly what the dot is. See, this matches
every character in the string. Same happens if we use the dot.</p>
<p id="an_inte">[19:02] An interesting thing you can do with negated character
classes is to provide an alternative of patterns like the ones we
discussed before. For example stripping HTML, you could either use
lazy quantifiers, by using the question mark, or you can use a
negated character class, which basically means anything that’s not
a closing angle bracket, as many times as you want.</p>
<p id="these_a">[19:27] These are basically equivalent, and the second one is
slightly faster. I feel I need to remind you again that it’s an
ANSI pattern to parse arbitrary HTML with regular expressions. I
need to say this because otherwise I’ll get people after the talk
telling me, "You shouldn’t do that." Well, if you know what to
expect you can do it, but in arbitrary HTML you shouldn’t.</p>
<p id="you_can">[19:53] You can use parentheses to group many alternatives, and the
pipe character as basically some sort of "or." In this case it
matches either AB or BA. It matches both of them, and here it
matches either of them. An interesting fact about parenthesis is
that they don’t just do grouping, they also capture. In this case
the entire regular expression matches the CBA, but what’s matched
by the parentheses is actually stored by the regular expression
engine. You can retrieve it if you use the proper methods.</p>
<p id="here_yo_id2">[20:36] Here you go to the entire match CBA or CAB, but also the
sub match of AB is stored. This is very useful in some cases
because otherwise you’d have to use multiple regular expressions on
the same thing, but in many cases you don’t really need it, and it
consumes extra memory. It’s slower, and in many cases you don’t
need it, like for example in this case. If you want to just match
both JavaScript and ECMAScript, and you don’t really care about
matching the substring that’s either Java or ECMA, you don’t really
need capturing here, do you?</p>
<p id="its_po">[21:14] It’s pointless, it just consumes memory for no reason. What
can you do? You can opt out of capturing by using a question mark
and the colon, and now you just have the entire match. This group
is ignored when capturing.</p>
<p id="this_is_id2">[21:32] This is the second of these challenges, it’s about matching
numbers, negative integers, positive integers, they can have a sign
in front of them, they may not have a sign in front of them, they
might be decimals, they might not have a part before the decimal
point, they might not have a part after the decimal point. That’s
why you have two minutes.</p>
<p id="silence_id4"><span class="emphasis"><em>[silence]</em></span></p>
<p id="ok_tim_id1">[23:53] OK, time’s up. That got quite a few tweets, and some of
them are very, very close.</p>
<p id="silence_id5"><span class="emphasis"><em>[silence]</em></span></p>
<p id="one_fir">[24:12] One first thought might be something like this. It matches
the optional sign, and it matches any number of digits, or decimal
points… By the way, an interesting thing is that here the dot
doesn’t need to be escaped, even though it’s a meta-character,
because it’s inside a character class, and it matches any number of
them in any order. The problem is it’s too lax.</p>
<p id="it_does">[24:39] It does match the numbers we’re interested in, but it also
has many false positives. It allows any number of decimal points,
even consecutive dots with no numbers at all. This is something
that’s much closer, and it’s what I used to do. I think it’s quite
good, the only problem is it has one significant false negative. It
doesn’t allow numbers that just have a part before the decimal
point, and the decimal point, and nothing after that.</p>
<p id="it_depe">[25:19] It depends on whether you want to allow these numbers. Many
people are OK with not allowing them. Another alternative is this,
which is basically the same as the previous one, except there’s a
star here instead of a plus sign. That means it matches any number
of digits after the decimal point, even zero. That solves the
problem of the previous one, but it allows many false positives,
like just a dot, or just a sign and a dot, and things like that.</p>
<p id="somethi">[25:52] Something that’s accurate is the last one, it matches
exactly the kinds of numbers we want and it doesn’t have any false
positives that I can think of, at least. But is it really worth it?
Sometimes it’s better to allow some false positives, or some false
negatives, depending on your application, rather than writing a
huge regular expression that matches exactly what you want,
especially on the client side, like for data validation, for
example, since you’re going to verify them on the server side
anyway.</p>
<p id="if_we_w">[26:31] If we want to match something that’s explicitly in the
beginning of the string, for example an "a," but only if it’s in
the beginning of the string, we can use the caret character. Here
the "a" doesn’t match because it’s inside the string, it needs to
be in the beginning of the string to match. There’s also something
similar we can do about the end of the string.</p>
<p id="here_th">[26:50] Here the "a" will only match if it’s at the end of the
string, and in the beginning because we also have the caret here.
If we have both of them the string will only match a literal "a,"
so it’s kind of pointless to use a regular expression in this case.
Just compare the two strings. You can also change the way these
anchors behave if you use the M flag.</p>
<p id="here_s">[27:20] Here, since we don’t have the M flag, this needs to be both
at the beginning and the end of the string. If we have a line
break, and we use a multi-line flag, the correct character matches
at the beginning of every line, and the dollar sign matches at the
end of every line. We can have anything here, and as long as "a" is
on its own line, it will match. These anchors are very useful in
the poly fill for string prototype trim.</p>
<p id="thats__id3">[28:00] That’s the shortest poly fill you can write about that
function. Basically it replaces whitespace that’s either in the
beginning, or at the end of the string. It’s more performant to
split this regular expression into two, and do two replaces. One
for the white space in the beginning, and one for the white space
at the end, but I think that’s a bit of premature optimization in
most cases, and sometimes being concise is better than saving one
millisecond.</p>
<p id="this_is_id3">[28:34] This is called an assertion, because it matches… It never
consumes any characters. For example, if you have something like
this, it matches at this point between the dollar sign and the
five. The reason is that the word boundaries match anywhere you
have… At any point between a word character and a non-word
character. Remember when we explained what these predefined
character classes do.</p>
<p id="one_mat">[29:14] One matches letters, and digits, and the underscore
character, and the other one is the exact opposite. The word
boundary matches at any point where you have one character that’s
not a word character, and it’s next to another that is. For
example, here it matches two times, because the order isn’t
significant. It will also match on the beginning of the string.</p>
<p id="if_you__id1">[29:43] If you have a word character that’s at the beginning of the
string, or at the end of the string, the beginning of the string
and the end of the string are basically treated like non-word
characters in this case.</p>
<p id="thats__id4">[29:57] That’s very useful. If you remember, before we got class
list in HTML5, we needed to write our own functions for adding
classes or replacing classes or removing classes. Usually, those
functions created the regular expression on the fly. It had the
class name between word characters, so it matched when it wasn’t
the entire string or when it was part of it or if it was in the
middle.</p>
<p id="of_cour_id1">[30:30] Of course, it’s consistent with everything we saw so far.
There’s also a negative word boundary, a known word boundary, which
is basically the opposite. A known-word boundary matches between
two word characters or between two known word characters like this,
for example.</p>
<p id="asserti">[30:59] Assertions, like we showed, are always zero width. In most
cases, if you just care about testing whether a string fits a
particular format, you don’t need to use assertions. Assertions are
very useful when you care about what matched, not only if it
matched.</p>
<p id="there_a">[31:19] There are also much more complex assertions, which are
called "look-aheads." In this case, you want to match a B that’s
after an A. This does exactly what you want, but what if you want
to only match an A if it precedes a B? But you don’t want to
actually match the B. You can use a look-ahead for that. That’s
exactly what this says. I want to match the A when a B follows. But
the look-ahead itself doesn’t take part in the matching. What I
find quite interesting is that you can even include capturing
groups inside the look-ahead.</p>
<p id="so_in_t">[32:09] So in this case, you will match a zero string, because this
entire regular expression matches the zero string, but you will
also match a B, because that’s outside the full match, because it’s
included in capturing parentheses. This should actually be under
the B. It appears I found a bug in this little app. But it should
actually match the B.</p>
<p id="theres_id3">[32:44] There’s also a negative version of a look-ahead. This
basically means match the A when it’s not followed by B. So
anything could be after it and it will still match, except B. This
is incredibly useful, and in most languages there’s also the
opposite concept of a look-behind that matches things only if
they’re after other things. That’s called look-behind.
Unfortunately ECMA Script doesn’t have look-behind. There’s some
discussion about adding it on ECMA Script next. I really hope it
makes it. But right now, there’s no browser that supports look-
behind in ECMA Script, sadly.</p>
<p id="this_is_id4">[33:32] This is the third of these challenges. It’s about matching
dates. It’s actually almost impossible with a regular expression to
match any valid date. There’s always going to be some false
positives. Basically the one who wins this challenge is whoever
gets closest.</p>
<p id="silence_id6"><span class="emphasis"><em>[silence]</em></span></p>
<p id="ok_tim_id2">[35:39] OK, time’s up.</p>
<p id="good_t">[35:46] Good, this one seems to be the closest, by Croft Dracula,
from a first glance, at least. It’s really hard to tell so quickly.</p>
<p id="one_ver">[36:00] One very loose regular expression for it could be this.
Like I said, that’s quite loose. It will match months like 99 or
days like 99, for example, which don’t really exist.</p>
<p id="the_clo">[36:14] The closest one would be something like this, which at
least matches the correct months and the correct days. It also has
some flaws. It will match dates like thirty-first of February, for
example, which never exists, or it will match dates like twenty-
ninth of February, which only exists for certain years.</p>
<p id="if_we_r">[36:40] If we really try to go that deeply with regular
expressions, the result will be… It’s either impossible to do
that or you’ll end up with a huge regular expression that nobody
will be able to read. It’s basically the same thing as I was saying
before. Sometimes you need to know when to stop.</p>
<p id="a_very_">[37:03] A very interesting thing you can do with look-ahead is to
mimic certain patterns, like intersections, like when you want a
certain string to match multiple regular expressions. Usually, you
do that at the code level.</p>
<p id="if_our_">[37:20] If our string matches this regular expression and it
matches this regular expression and it matches this regular
expression, like in the JavaScript. You can actually do that just
on the regular expression level by using once regular expression
because it takes advantage of the fact that look-aheads don’t
change the matching position, so if you have something after the
look-ahead, it matches at the same position as the look-ahead
started from. You can have any number of look-aheads after the
first one, and they will match on the same string because it
doesn’t advance the matching position.</p>
<p id="basical">[37:54] Basically, in this case, for example, you want to have a
six-letter password or more with at least one number, one letter,
and one symbol. Doing this without look-aheads would be really
hard, so most people would result in doing it with multiple regular
expressions.</p>
<p id="if_you__id2">[38:09] If you use look-aheads, you can have this look-ahead that
checks if there’s at least one digit. Then this starts matching at
the same position since the first one doesn’t consume anything and
it checks that there’s at least one letter. This one checks that
there’s at least one symbol.</p>
<p id="finally">[38:29] Finally, if you want to actually match the string, you have
this that matches anything that has at least six characters.
Basically, you have one regular expression, one line that matches
all these conditions.</p>
<p id="similar_id2">[38:43] Similarly, you can do subtraction, like any number that’s
not divisible by 50, something that matches this pattern but
doesn’t match this pattern. That’s basically a very similar thing.
You’re just using negative look-ahead instead of positive look-
ahead.</p>
<p id="of_cour_id2">[38:58] Of course, you can use a sub case of the previous, of
subtraction, which is negation. Anything that doesn’t match one
pattern, which is basically a negative look-ahead, and then you
have anything. Like a dot that can match any number of characters,
this one matches pretty much anything. If you also want a match
line breaks, it’s quite easy to wrap it in a character class. That
will match any kind of string that doesn’t contain foo, again, that
would be really hard to do with plain regular expressions, without
look-ahead.</p>
<p id="the_las">[39:38] The last part of the syntax, if you want to write something
like a code highlighter, it’ll probably encounter something like
this. This is supposed to match strings, for example, this. The
problem with the regular expression I have here is that will also
match strings like this, where the quote marks are mismatched, and
that’s really bad because you might actually have double quote
marks inside a string with single quote marks.</p>
<p id="for_exa">[40:11] For example, "He said, <span class="emphasis"><em>boo.</em></span>" And it only matches part of
the string, that’s wrong. It could seriously break an application.
You can use back references, which is basically a slash and a
number. The number refers to the index of the capturing group you
have. Remember parentheses create capturing groups, the regex
engine remembers what parentheses matched, and you can actually use
what it remembers in the same regular expression by using this.</p>
<p id="this_ba">[40:50] This basically means, "I want to match here whatever this
matched. If it matched a single quote, this is equivalent to a
single quote, if it matched a double quote, that’s equivalent to a
double quote." You can match strings properly. Of course this has
some problems as well, it doesn’t account for escaped quote marks.
Like this is treated like a quote mark that delimits the string,
where it actually should be ignored, it should be treated as a
regular character.</p>
<p id="which_b">[41:25] Which brings us to the next to the last challenge, which is
to improve that regular expression, I remind you the regular
expression was this, so that it actually accounts for this case,
escaped quote marks, and it also accounts for double backslashes,
escaped backslashes. I think the answer to that is pretty much the
most elegant regular expression I’ve seen, as you’ll see after
this.</p>
<p id="silence_id7"><span class="emphasis"><em>[silence]</em></span></p>
<p id="ok_tim_id3">[43:52] OK, time’s up. The answer is basically this, it’s very
similar to the previous one. It kind of takes advantage of how
regex engines work, so if they can match a backslash with
something, they will match it. But they also have to match the
quote mark at the end, so that basically takes into account all the
cases that are of interest to us, so it matches exactly what we
want. I think it’s really elegant for what it does.</p>
<p id="i_didn">[44:27] I didn’t come up with it, I came up with something very
close, it’s Steven Levithan that came up with it. To wrap up, some
best practices. Like I said many times throughout this talk,
sometimes practicality wins over precision. Sometimes you need to
accept the fact that you will allow some false positives, or some
false negatives, otherwise it will drive you crazy. This regular
expression at the end is what you need to use to match email
addresses if you want to be really, really precise.</p>
<p id="is_that">[45:01] Is that practical? I don’t think so, that’s huge. I don’t
think any sane developer would actually use this. When you’re
matching email addresses, anything shorter will allow some false
positives, or some false negatives, it depends on your application
which of the two you will allow. For example, if you’re doing form
validation, it’s usually better to allow false positives than false
negatives, because if somebody has an email address you didn’t
foresee when you were crafting your regular expression, they’ll go
through a very distressing experience.</p>
<p id="their_v">[45:36] Their very valid email address won’t be allowed, and it’s
pointless anyway, because they may as well enter an email address
that doesn’t exist, but has a very valid format. It’s better to
allow some degrees of freedom there. Also, keep it simple. If you
can do it without using regular expressions in an amount of code
that’s not insane, don’t use regular expressions. Obviously, if the
alternative is using 10 lines of code to do it with string
functions, regular expressions are better.</p>
<p id="but_if_">[46:09] But if you can do it with just an index of, for example,
just use the string function, it’s faster. Speaking about
performance some tips are, avoid greedy quantifiers, if it fits
your use case, better convert them to lazy ones.</p>
<p id="dont_f">[46:27] Don’t forget anchors, obviously if it fits your use case,
try to use anchors, because that means the regular expression can
realize it failed, the match failed much more early, so it doesn’t
need to try many different combinations, which basically… a
special case of the third point.</p>
<p id="be_as_s">[46:49] Be as specific as possible. For example, don’t use the dot
when you really need to match a letter for example, just use a
character class, which is much more specific.</p>
<p id="prefer_">[47:03] Prefer known capturing groups. If you don’t need to
capture, just add this question mark and the colon. It’s faster.</p>
<p id="minimiz">[47:09] Minimize backtracking. Backtracking is what the regular
expression engine will do when it starts matching and goes on and
on and then it realizes, "Oops, I went too far," so it backtracks.
It backtracks one position, one character, and then another
character, until it finds a match.</p>
<p id="if_you__id3">[47:29] If you can avoid this behavior, try to avoid it. It can be
very costly. In some cases, it can even completely make your
application hang. There are some cases about that. Google the term
"distractive backtracking," I think. There are some regular
expressions that are so bad in that regard that can completely hang
your application with very short strings.</p>

something.</p>

<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title">Video Transcript</h2></div></div></div>
<p id="mac_slocum_"><span class="strong"><strong>Mac Slocum:</strong></span> [0:01] Why are regular expressions important?</p>
<p id="lea_verou_"><span class="strong"><strong>Lea Verou:</strong></span> [0:03] Regular expressions can greatly simplify lots of common code
sequences. In many cases, you can condense 100 lines of code into
single-line regular expressions.</p>
<p id="regular__id3">[0:14] Regular expressions is just a language that describes a set
of strings. Every time you need to test if a string matches a
certain pattern, for example, is something an email address? Or if
you want to extract part of a string, like extracting, for example,
all the words in a text. Or counting them, or validating data.</p>
<p id="regular__id4">[0:35] Regular expressions can greatly help in all of these cases,
and they’re usually much more performant than having 100 lines of
string manipulation functions.</p>
<p id="slocum___id1"><span class="strong"><strong>Slocum:</strong></span> [0:43] Is it one of those skills that falls through the cracks? One
of those things that it’s worth doubling back to make sure that
you’ve got that in your tool set?</p>
<p id="verou__i_id1"><span class="strong"><strong>Verou:</strong></span> [0:51] I think many developers don’t focus enough on regular
expressions, because they’re considered one of the least exciting
aspects of programming. They tend to get excited about new APIs,
cool stuff, new frameworks, and libraries. That’s something that’s
doesn’t have lots of…It’s not considered cool.</p>
<p id="slocum___id2"><span class="strong"><strong>Slocum:</strong></span> [1:12] Switching gears a little bit, moving over to CSS a bit, do
you think we’ll get to a point where we don’t have proprietary CSS
elements anymore, or is that just wishful thinking?</p>
<p id="verou__t_id1"><span class="strong"><strong>Verou:</strong></span> [1:24] That depends on how we treat the ones we have today. If we
keep developing for proprietary features of certain browsers, the
same way people develop for WebKit-only stuff today, then yes,
companies will still do it, because it helps them advance in the
browser market.</p>
<p id="that_bas">[1:41] That basically hurts web developers. Remember what happened
when we got a very cool browser, with many cool, shiny, proprietary
features? Web developers got really excited about that browser and
its proprietary features, they started using them, and then we got
locked in that browser, and we got a decade of IE6. IE6 was a great
browser when it was released.</p>
<p id="slocum___id3"><span class="strong"><strong>Slocum:</strong></span> [2:05] 10 years later, not so much. Last question for you. What is
your process for experimenting with a new feature? What’s the
criteria that it has to meet, for you?</p>
<p id="verou__i_id2"><span class="strong"><strong>Verou:</strong></span> [2:16] I guess the criteria is that I usually want the feature to
have at least one implementation. It’s really hard to experiment
with something that’s just a spec, and doesn’t have any
implementations. Quite often, there are specs that never get
implemented. There’s no interest from browsers, so they never
implement them, even though they exist for years.
For example, there used to be a spec that defined how we can have
multiple pseudo-elements. Multiple :before pseudo-elements
or :after pseudo-elements, or multiple ::outside pseudo-elements.
It was really exciting. Browsers didn’t care, they didn’t implement
it. We had to actually drop the features in that spec, because when
there is no interest the specs changes.</p>
